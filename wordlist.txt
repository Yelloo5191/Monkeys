I
PROLOGUE
TWO
HOUSEHOLDS,
BOTH
ALIKE
IN
DIGNITY,
IN
FAIR
VERONA,
WHERE
WE
LAY
OUR
SCENE,
FROM
ANCIENT
GRUDGE
BREAK
TO
NEW
MUTINY,
WHERE
CIVIL
BLOOD
MAKES
CIVIL
HANDS
UNCLEAN.
FROM
FORTH
THE
FATAL
LOINS
OF
THESE
TWO
FOES
A
PAIR
OF
STAR-CROSS'D
LOVERS
TAKE
THEIR
LIFE;
WHOSE
MISADVENTURED
PITEOUS
OVERTHROWS
DO
WITH
THEIR
DEATH
BURY
THEIR
PARENTS'
STRIFE.
THE
FEARFUL
PASSAGE
OF
THEIR
DEATH-MARK'D
LOVE,
AND
THE
CONTINUANCE
OF
THEIR
PARENTS'
RAGE,
WHICH,
BUT
THEIR
CHILDREN'S
END,
NOUGHT
COULD
REMOVE,
IS
NOW
THE
TWO
HOURS'
TRAFFIC
OF
OUR
STAGE;
THE
WHICH
IF
YOU
WITH
PATIENT
EARS
ATTEND,
WHAT
HERE
SHALL
MISS,
OUR
TOIL
SHALL
STRIVE
TO
MEND.
SCENE
I.
VERONA.
A
PUBLIC
PLACE.
ENTER
SAMPSON
AND
GREGORY,
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
CAPULET,
ARMED
WITH
SWORDS
AND
BUCKLERS
SAMPSON
GREGORY,
O'
MY
WORD,
WE'LL
NOT
CARRY
COALS.
GREGORY
NO,
FOR
THEN
WE
SHOULD
BE
COLLIERS.
SAMPSON
I
MEAN,
AN
WE
BE
IN
CHOLER,
WE'LL
DRAW.
GREGORY
AY,
WHILE
YOU
LIVE,
DRAW
YOUR
NECK
OUT
O'
THE
COLLAR.
SAMPSON
I
STRIKE
QUICKLY,
BEING
MOVED.
GREGORY
BUT
THOU
ART
NOT
QUICKLY
MOVED
TO
STRIKE.
SAMPSON
A
DOG
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
MONTAGUE
MOVES
ME.
GREGORY
TO
MOVE
IS
TO
STIR;
AND
TO
BE
VALIANT
IS
TO
STAND:
THEREFORE,
IF
THOU
ART
MOVED,
THOU
RUNN'ST
AWAY.
SAMPSON
A
DOG
OF
THAT
HOUSE
SHALL
MOVE
ME
TO
STAND:
I
WILL
TAKE
THE
WALL
OF
ANY
MAN
OR
MAID
OF
MONTAGUE'S.
GREGORY
THAT
SHOWS
THEE
A
WEAK
SLAVE;
FOR
THE
WEAKEST
GOES
TO
THE
WALL.
SAMPSON
TRUE;
AND
THEREFORE
WOMEN,
BEING
THE
WEAKER
VESSELS,
ARE
EVER
THRUST
TO
THE
WALL:
THEREFORE
I
WILL
PUSH
MONTAGUE'S
MEN
FROM
THE
WALL,
AND
THRUST
HIS
MAIDS
TO
THE
WALL.
GREGORY
THE
QUARREL
IS
BETWEEN
OUR
MASTERS
AND
US
THEIR
MEN.
SAMPSON
'TIS
ALL
ONE,
I
WILL
SHOW
MYSELF
A
TYRANT:
WHEN
I
HAVE
FOUGHT
WITH
THE
MEN,
I
WILL
BE
CRUEL
WITH
THE
MAIDS,
AND
CUT
OFF
THEIR
HEADS.
GREGORY
THE
HEADS
OF
THE
MAIDS?
SAMPSON
AY,
THE
HEADS
OF
THE
MAIDS,
OR
THEIR
MAIDENHEADS;
TAKE
IT
IN
WHAT
SENSE
THOU
WILT.
GREGORY
THEY
MUST
TAKE
IT
IN
SENSE
THAT
FEEL
IT.
SAMPSON
ME
THEY
SHALL
FEEL
WHILE
I
AM
ABLE
TO
STAND:
AND
'TIS
KNOWN
I
AM
A
PRETTY
PIECE
OF
FLESH.
GREGORY
'TIS

IF
THOU

BEEN
POOR
JOHN.
DRAW

SAMPSON
MY

GREGORY
HOW!
TURN
THY

AND
RUN?
SAMPSON
FEAR
ME
NOT.
GREGORY
NO,
MARRY;
I
FEAR
THEE!
SAMPSON
LET
US
TAKE
THE
LAW
OF
OUR
SIDES;
LET
THEM
BEGIN.
GREGORY
I
WILL
FROWN
AS
I
PASS
BY,
AND
LET
THEM
TAKE
IT
AS
THEY
LIST.
SAMPSON
NAY,
AS
THEY
DARE.
I
WILL
BITE
MY
THUMB
AT
THEM;
WHICH
IS
A
DISGRACE
TO
THEM,
IF
THEY
BEAR
IT.
ENTER
ABRAHAM

HO!
YOU

BEASTS,
THAT
QUENCH
THE
FIRE
OF
YOUR
PERNICIOUS
RAGE
WITH
PURPLE
FOUNTAINS
ISSUING
FROM

ON
PAIN
OF
TORTURE,
FROM
THOSE
BLOODY
HANDS
THROW
YOUR
MISTEMPER'D
WEAPONS
TO
THE
GROUND,
AND
HEAR
THE
SENTENCE
OF
YOUR
MOVED
PRINCE.
THREE
CIVIL
BRAWLS,
BRED
OF
AN
AIRY
WORD,
BY
THEE,
OLD
CAPULET,
AND
MONTAGUE,
HAVE
THRICE
DISTURB'D
THE
QUIET
OF
OUR
STREETS,
AND
MADE
VERONA'S
ANCIENT
CITIZENS
CAST
BY
THEIR
GRAVE
BESEEMING
ORNAMENTS,
TO
WIELD
OLD
PARTISANS,
IN
HANDS
AS
OLD,
CANKER'D
WITH
PEACE,
TO
PART
YOUR
CANKER'D
HATE:
IF
EVER
YOU
DISTURB
OUR
STREETS
AGAIN,
YOUR
LIVES
SHALL

THE
FORFEIT
OF
THE
PEACE.
FOR
THIS
TIME,
ALL
THE
REST
DEPART

MONTAGUE,
COME

AFTERNOON,
TO
KNOW
OUR
FURTHER
PLEASURE
IN
THIS
CASE,
TO
OLD
FREE-TOWN,
OUR
COMMON
JUDGMENT-PLACE.
ONCE
MORE,
ON
PAIN
OF
DEATH,
ALL
MEN
DEPART.
EXEUNT
ALL
BUT
MONTAGUE,
LADY
MONTAGUE,
AND
BENVOLIO

MONTAGUE
WHO
SET
THIS
ANCIENT
QUARREL
NEW
ABROACH?
SPEAK,
NEPHEW,
WERE
YOU
BY
WHEN
IT
BEGAN?
BENVOLIO
HERE
WERE
THE
SERVANTS
OF
YOUR
ADVERSARY,
AND
YOURS,
CLOSE
FIGHTING
ERE
I
DID
APPROACH:
I
DREW
TO
PART
THEM:
IN
THE
INSTANT
CAME
THE
FIERY
TYBALT,
WITH
HIS
SWORD
PREPARED,
WHICH,
AS
HE
BREATHED
DEFIANCE
TO
MY
EARS,
HE
SWUNG
ABOUT
HIS
HEAD
AND
CUT
THE
WINDS,
WHO
NOTHING
HURT
WITHAL
HISS'D
HIM
IN
SCORN:
WHILE
WE
WERE
INTERCHANGING
THRUSTS
AND
BLOWS,
CAME
MORE
AND
MORE
AND
FOUGHT
ON
PART
AND
PART,
TILL
THE
PRINCE
CAME,
WHO
PARTED
EITHER
PART.
LADY
MONTAGUE
O,
WHERE
IS
ROMEO?
SAW
YOU
HIM
TO-DAY?
RIGHT
GLAD
I
AM
HE
WAS
NOT
AT
THIS
FRAY.
BENVOLIO
MADAM,
AN
HOUR
BEFORE
THE
WORSHIPP'D
SUN
PEER'D
FORTH
THE
GOLDEN
WINDOW
OF
THE
EAST,
A
TROUBLED
MIND
DRAVE
ME
TO
WALK
ABROAD;
WHERE,
UNDERNEATH
THE
GROVE
OF
SYCAMORE
THAT
WESTWARD
ROOTETH
FROM
THE
CITY'S
SIDE,
SO
EARLY
WALKING
DID
I
SEE
YOUR
SON:
TOWARDS
HIM
I
MADE,
BUT
HE
WAS
WARE
OF
ME
AND
STOLE
INTO
THE
COVERT
OF
THE
WOOD:
I,
MEASURING
HIS
AFFECTIONS
BY
MY
OWN,
THAT
MOST
ARE
BUSIED
WHEN
THEY'RE
MOST
ALONE,
PURSUED
MY
HUMOUR
NOT
PURSUING
HIS,
AND
GLADLY
SHUNN'D
WHO
GLADLY
FLED
FROM
ME.
MONTAGUE
MANY
A
MORNING
HATH
HE
THERE
BEEN
SEEN,
WITH
TEARS
AUGMENTING
THE
FRESH
MORNING
DEW.
ADDING
TO
CLOUDS
MORE
CLOUDS
WITH
HIS
DEEP
SIGHS;
BUT
ALL
SO
SOON
AS
THE
ALL-CHEERING
SUN
SHOULD
IN
THE
FURTHEST
EAST
BEGIN
TO
DRAW
THE
SHADY
CURTAINS
FROM
AURORA'S
BED,
AWAY
FROM
THE
LIGHT
STEALS
HOME
MY
HEAVY
SON,
AND
PRIVATE
IN
HIS
CHAMBER
PENS
HIMSELF,
SHUTS
UP
HIS
WINDOWS,
LOCKS
FAR
DAYLIGHT
OUT
AND
MAKES
HIMSELF
AN
ARTIFICIAL
NIGHT:
BLACK
AND
PORTENTOUS
MUST
THIS
HUMOUR
PROVE,
UNLESS
GOOD
COUNSEL
MAY
THE
CAUSE
REMOVE.
BENVOLIO
MY
NOBLE
UNCLE,
DO
YOU
KNOW
THE
CAUSE?
MONTAGUE
I
NEITHER
KNOW
IT
NOR
CAN
LEARN
OF
HIM.
BENVOLIO
HAVE
YOU
IMPORTUNED
HIM
BY
ANY
MEANS?
MONTAGUE
BOTH
BY
MYSELF
AND
MANY
OTHER
FRIENDS:
BUT
HE,
HIS
OWN
AFFECTIONS'
COUNSELLOR,
IS
TO
HIMSELF--I
WILL
NOT
SAY
HOW
TRUE--
BUT
TO
HIMSELF
SO
SECRET
AND
SO
CLOSE,
SO
FAR
FROM
SOUNDING
AND
DISCOVERY,
AS
IS
THE
BUD
BIT
WITH
AN
ENVIOUS
WORM,
ERE
HE
CAN
SPREAD
HIS
SWEET
LEAVES
TO
THE
AIR,
OR
DEDICATE
HIS
BEAUTY
TO
THE
SUN.
COULD
WE
BUT
LEARN
FROM
WHENCE
HIS
SORROWS
GROW.
WE
WOULD
AS
WILLINGLY
GIVE
CURE
AS
KNOW.
ENTER
ROMEO

BENVOLIO
SEE,
WHERE
HE
COMES:
SO
PLEASE
YOU,
STEP
ASIDE;
I'LL
KNOW
HIS
GRIEVANCE,
OR
BE
MUCH
DENIED.
MONTAGUE
I
WOULD
THOU
WERT
SO
HAPPY
BY
THY
STAY,
TO
HEAR
TRUE
SHRIFT.
COME,
MADAM,
LET'S
AWAY.
EXEUNT
MONTAGUE
AND
LADY
MONTAGUE

BENVOLIO
GOOD-MORROW,
COUSIN.
ROMEO
IS
THE
DAY
SO
YOUNG?
BENVOLIO
BUT
NEW
STRUCK
NINE.
ROMEO
AY
ME!
SAD
HOURS
SEEM
LONG.
WAS
THAT
MY
FATHER
THAT
WENT
HENCE
SO
FAST?
BENVOLIO
IT
WAS.
WHAT
SADNESS
LENGTHENS
ROMEO'S
HOURS?
ROMEO
NOT
HAVING
THAT,
WHICH,
HAVING,
MAKES
THEM
SHORT.
BENVOLIO
IN
LOVE?
ROMEO
OUT--
BENVOLIO
OF
LOVE?
ROMEO
OUT
OF
HER
FAVOUR,
WHERE
I
AM
IN
LOVE.
BENVOLIO
ALAS,
THAT
LOVE,
SO
GENTLE
IN
HIS
VIEW,
SHOULD
BE
SO
TYRANNOUS
AND
ROUGH
IN
PROOF!
ROMEO
ALAS,
THAT
LOVE,
WHOSE
VIEW
IS
MUFFLED
STILL,
SHOULD,
WITHOUT
EYES,
SEE
PATHWAYS
TO
HIS
WILL!
WHERE
SHALL
WE
DINE?
O
ME!
WHAT
FRAY
WAS
HERE?
YET
TELL
ME
NOT,
FOR
I
HAVE
HEARD
IT
ALL.
HERE'S
MUCH
TO
DO
WITH
HATE,
BUT
MORE
WITH
LOVE.
WHY,
THEN,
O
BRAWLING
LOVE!
O
LOVING
HATE!
O
ANY
THING,
OF
NOTHING
FIRST
CREATE!
O
HEAVY
LIGHTNESS!
SERIOUS
VANITY!
MIS-SHAPEN
CHAOS
OF
WELL-SEEMING
FORMS!
FEATHER
OF
LEAD,
BRIGHT
SMOKE,
COLD
FIRE,
SICK
HEALTH!
STILL-WAKING
SLEEP,
THAT
IS
NOT
WHAT
IT
IS!
THIS
LOVE
FEEL
I,
THAT
FEEL
NO
LOVE
IN
THIS.
DOST
THOU
NOT
LAUGH?
BENVOLIO
NO,
COZ,
I
RATHER
WEEP.
ROMEO
GOOD
HEART,
AT
WHAT?
BENVOLIO
AT
THY
GOOD
HEART'S
OPPRESSION.
ROMEO
WHY,
SUCH
IS
LOVE'S
TRANSGRESSION.
GRIEFS
OF
MINE
OWN
LIE
HEAVY
IN
MY
BREAST,
WHICH
THOU
WILT
PROPAGATE,
TO
HAVE
IT
PREST
WITH
MORE
OF
THINE:
THIS
LOVE
THAT
THOU
HAST
SHOWN
DOTH
ADD
MORE
GRIEF
TO
TOO
MUCH
OF
MINE
OWN.
LOVE
IS
A
SMOKE
RAISED
WITH
THE
FUME
OF
SIGHS;
BEING
PURGED,
A
FIRE
SPARKLING
IN
LOVERS'
EYES;
BEING
VEX'D
A
SEA
NOURISH'D
WITH
LOVERS'
TEARS:
WHAT
IS
IT
ELSE?
A
MADNESS
MOST
DISCREET,
A
CHOKING
GALL
AND
A
PRESERVING
SWEET.
FAREWELL,
MY
COZ.
BENVOLIO
SOFT!
I
WILL
GO
ALONG;
AN
IF
YOU
LEAVE
ME
SO,
YOU
DO
ME
WRONG.
ROMEO
TUT,
I
HAVE
LOST
MYSELF;
I
AM
NOT
HERE;
THIS
IS
NOT
ROMEO,
HE'S
SOME
OTHER
WHERE.
BENVOLIO
TELL
ME
IN
SADNESS,
WHO
IS
THAT
YOU
LOVE.
ROMEO
WHAT,
SHALL
I
GROAN
AND
TELL
THEE?
BENVOLIO
GROAN!
WHY,
NO.
BUT
SADLY
TELL
ME
WHO.
ROMEO
BID
A
SICK
MAN
IN
SADNESS
MAKE
HIS
WILL:
AH,
WORD
ILL
URGED
TO
ONE
THAT
IS
SO
ILL!
IN
SADNESS,
COUSIN,
I
DO
LOVE
A
WOMAN.
BENVOLIO
I
AIM'D
SO
NEAR,
WHEN
I
SUPPOSED
YOU
LOVED.
ROMEO
A
RIGHT
GOOD
MARK-MAN!
AND
SHE'S
FAIR
I
LOVE.
BENVOLIO
A
RIGHT
FAIR
MARK,
FAIR
COZ,
IS
SOONEST
HIT.
ROMEO
WELL,
IN
THAT
HIT
YOU
MISS:
SHE'LL
NOT
BE
HIT
WITH
CUPID'S
ARROW;
SHE
HATH
DIAN'S
WIT;
AND,
IN
STRONG
PROOF
OF
CHASTITY
WELL
ARM'D,
FROM
LOVE'S
WEAK
CHILDISH
BOW
SHE
LIVES
UNHARM'D.
SHE
WILL
NOT
STAY
THE
SIEGE
OF
LOVING
TERMS,
NOR
BIDE
THE
ENCOUNTER
OF
ASSAILING
EYES,
NOR
OPE
HER
LAP
TO
SAINT-SEDUCING
GOLD:
O,
SHE
IS
RICH
IN
BEAUTY,
ONLY
POOR,
THAT
WHEN
SHE
DIES
WITH
BEAUTY
DIES
HER
STORE.
BENVOLIO
THEN
SHE
HATH
SWORN
THAT
SHE
WILL
STILL
LIVE
CHASTE?
ROMEO
SHE
HATH,
AND
IN
THAT
SPARING
MAKES
HUGE
WASTE,
FOR
BEAUTY
STARVED
WITH
HER
SEVERITY
CUTS
BEAUTY
OFF
FROM
ALL
POSTERITY.
SHE
IS
TOO
FAIR,
TOO
WISE,
WISELY
TOO
FAIR,
TO
MERIT
BLISS
BY
MAKING
ME
DESPAIR:
SHE
HATH
FORSWORN
TO
LOVE,
AND
IN
THAT
VOW
DO
I
LIVE
DEAD
THAT
LIVE
TO
TELL
IT
NOW.
BENVOLIO
BE
RULED
BY
ME,
FORGET
TO
THINK
OF
HER.
ROMEO
O,
TEACH
ME
HOW
I
SHOULD
FORGET
TO
THINK.
BENVOLIO
BY
GIVING
LIBERTY
UNTO
THINE
EYES;
EXAMINE
OTHER
BEAUTIES.
ROMEO
'TIS
THE
WAY
TO
CALL
HERS
EXQUISITE,
IN
QUESTION
MORE:
THESE
HAPPY
MASKS
THAT
KISS
FAIR
LADIES'
BROWS
BEING
BLACK
PUT
US
IN
MIND
THEY
HIDE
THE
FAIR;
HE
THAT
IS
STRUCKEN
BLIND
CANNOT
FORGET
THE
PRECIOUS
TREASURE
OF
HIS
EYESIGHT
LOST:
SHOW
ME
A
MISTRESS
THAT
IS
PASSING
FAIR,
WHAT
DOTH
HER
BEAUTY
SERVE,
BUT
AS
A
NOTE
WHERE
I
MAY
READ
WHO
PASS'D
THAT
PASSING
FAIR?
FAREWELL:
THOU
CANST
NOT
TEACH
ME
TO
FORGET.
BENVOLIO
I'LL
PAY
THAT
DOCTRINE,
OR
ELSE
DIE
IN
DEBT.

OF
FOURTEEN
YEARS,
LET
TWO

ERE
WE

SOULS!--
WERE
OF
AN

WELL,
SUSAN
IS
WITH
GOD;
SHE
WAS
TOO
GOOD
FOR
ME:
BUT,
AS
I
SAID,
ON
LAMMAS-EVE
AT
NIGHT
SHALL
SHE
BE
FOURTEEN;
THAT
SHALL
SHE,
MARRY;
I
REMEMBER
IT

'TIS
SINCE
THE

ELEVEN

SHE
WAS
WEAN'D,--I
NEVER
SHALL
FORGET
IT,--
OF
ALL
THE

OF
THE

UPON
THAT
DAY:
FOR
I
HAD
THEN
LAID
WORMWOOD
TO
MY

SITTING
IN

UNDER
THE
DOVE-HOUSE
WALL;
MY
LORD
AND
YOU
WERE
THEN
AT

NAY,
I
DO
BEAR
A
BRAIN:--BUT,
AS
I
SAID,
WHEN
IT
DID
TASTE
THE
WORMWOOD
ON
THE
NIPPLE
OF
MY
DUG
AND
FELT
IT
BITTER,
PRETTY
FOOL,
TO
SEE
IT
TETCHY
AND
FALL
OUT
WITH
THE
DUG!
SHAKE
QUOTH
THE
DOVE-HOUSE:
'TWAS
NO

I
TROW,
TO

SINCE
THAT

STAND
ALONE;
NAY,
BY

ROOD,
SHE
COULD
HAVE
RUN

WADDLED
ALL
ABOUT;
FOR
EVEN
THE
DAY
BEFORE,
SHE
BROKE
HER
BROW:
AND
THEN
MY
HUSBAND--GOD
BE
WITH
HIS

A'
WAS
A
MERRY

'YEA,'

FALL
UPON
THY

THOU
WILT
FALL
BACKWARD
WHEN
THOU

WILT

AND,
BY
MY
HOLIDAME,
THE
PRETTY
WRETCH
LEFT
CRYING
AND
SAID
'AY.'
TO

NOW,
HOW
A
JEST

SAID
'AY.'
LADY
CAPULET
ENOUGH
OF
THIS;
I
PRAY
THEE,
HOLD
THY
PEACE.
NURSE
YES,
MADAM:
YET
I
CANNOT
CHOOSE
BUT
LAUGH,
TO
THINK
IT
SHOULD
LEAVE
CRYING
AND
SAY
'AY.'
AND
YET,
I
WARRANT,
IT
HAD
UPON
ITS
BROW
A
BUMP
AS
BIG
AS
A
YOUNG
COCKEREL'S
STONE;
A
PARLOUS
KNOCK;
AND
IT
CRIED
BITTERLY:
'YEA,'
QUOTH
MY
HUSBAND,'FALL'ST
UPON
THY

THOU
WILT
FALL
BACKWARD
WHEN
THOU
COMEST
TO

'AY.'

JULIET,
HOW

SOMETIME
SHE
GALLOPS
O'ER
A
COURTIER'S
NOSE,

DREAMS
HE
OF
SMELLING
OUT
A

AND
SOMETIME
COMES
SHE
WITH
A
TITHE-PIG'S
TAIL
TICKLING
A
PARSON'S

AS

DRIVETH

THEN
DREAMS
HE
OF
CUTTING
FOREIGN
THROATS,
OF
BREACHES,
AMBUSCADOES,
SPANISH

OF
HEALTHS
FIVE-FATHOM
DEEP;
AND
THEN
ANON
DRUMS
IN
HIS

AT
WHICH
HE
STARTS

WAKES,
AND
BEING
THUS
FRIGHTED
SWEARS
A
PRAYER

PLATS
THE

HORSES
IN

AND
BAKES
THE

IN
FOUL
SLUTTISH

WHICH

BODES:
THIS
IS
THE

PRESSES

LEARNS
THEM
FIRST

MAKING

MERCUTIO
TRUE,
I
TALK
OF

THE

BEGOT

VAIN
FANTASY,
WHICH
IS
AS
THIN

MORE
INCONSTANT
THAN

WHO
WOOES
EVEN

THE
FROZEN
BOSOM

BEING
ANGER'D,
PUFFS

FROM

TURNING

THAT
BIRDS
WOULD
SING
AND
THINK
IT
WERE
NOT
NIGHT.
SEE,
HOW
SHE
LEANS
HER
CHEEK
UPON
HER
HAND!
O,
THAT
I
WERE
A
GLOVE
UPON
THAT
HAND,
THAT
I
MIGHT
TOUCH
THAT
CHEEK!
JULIET
AY
ME!
ROMEO
SHE
SPEAKS:
O,
SPEAK
AGAIN,
BRIGHT
ANGEL!
FOR
THOU
ART
AS
GLORIOUS
TO
THIS
NIGHT,
BEING
O'ER
MY
HEAD
AS
IS
A
WINGED
MESSENGER
OF
HEAVEN
UNTO
THE
WHITE-UPTURNED
WONDERING
EYES
OF
MORTALS
THAT
FALL
BACK
TO
GAZE
ON
HIM
WHEN
HE
BESTRIDES
THE
LAZY-PACING
CLOUDS
AND
SAILS
UPON
THE
BOSOM
OF
THE
AIR.
JULIET
O
ROMEO,
ROMEO!
WHEREFORE
ART
THOU
ROMEO?
DENY
THY
FATHER
AND
REFUSE
THY
NAME;
OR,
IF
THOU
WILT
NOT,
BE
BUT
SWORN
MY
LOVE,
AND
I'LL
NO
LONGER
BE
A
CAPULET.
ROMEO
[ASIDE]
SHALL
I
HEAR
MORE,
OR
SHALL
I
SPEAK
AT
THIS?
JULIET
'TIS
BUT
THY
NAME
THAT
IS
MY
ENEMY;
THOU
ART
THYSELF,
THOUGH
NOT
A
MONTAGUE.
WHAT'S
MONTAGUE?
IT
IS
NOR
HAND,
NOR
FOOT,
NOR
ARM,
NOR
FACE,
NOR
ANY
OTHER
PART
BELONGING
TO
A
MAN.
O,
BE
SOME
OTHER
NAME!
WHAT'S
IN
A
NAME?
THAT
WHICH
WE
CALL
A
ROSE
BY
ANY
OTHER
NAME
WOULD
SMELL
AS
SWEET;
SO
ROMEO
WOULD,
WERE
HE
NOT
ROMEO
CALL'D,
RETAIN
THAT
DEAR
PERFECTION
WHICH
HE
OWES
WITHOUT
THAT
TITLE.
ROMEO,
DOFF
THY
NAME,
AND
FOR
THAT
NAME
WHICH
IS
NO
PART
OF
THEE
TAKE
ALL
MYSELF.
ROMEO
I
TAKE
THEE
AT
THY
WORD:
CALL
ME
BUT
LOVE,
AND
I'LL
BE
NEW
BAPTIZED;
HENCEFORTH
I
NEVER
WILL
BE
ROMEO.
JULIET
WHAT
MAN
ART
THOU
THAT
THUS
BESCREEN'D
IN
NIGHT
SO
STUMBLEST
ON
MY
COUNSEL?
ROMEO
BY
A
NAME
I
KNOW
NOT
HOW
TO
TELL
THEE
WHO
I
AM:
MY
NAME,
DEAR
SAINT,
IS
HATEFUL
TO
MYSELF,
BECAUSE
IT
IS
AN
ENEMY
TO
THEE;
HAD
I
IT
WRITTEN,
I
WOULD
TEAR
THE
WORD.
JULIET
MY
EARS
HAVE
NOT
YET
DRUNK
A
HUNDRED
WORDS
OF
THAT
TONGUE'S
UTTERANCE,
YET
I
KNOW
THE
SOUND:
ART
THOU
NOT
ROMEO
AND
A
MONTAGUE?
ROMEO
NEITHER,
FAIR
SAINT,
IF
EITHER
THEE
DISLIKE.
JULIET
HOW
CAMEST
THOU
HITHER,
TELL
ME,
AND
WHEREFORE?
THE
ORCHARD
WALLS
ARE
HIGH
AND
HARD
TO
CLIMB,
AND
THE
PLACE
DEATH,
CONSIDERING
WHO
THOU
ART,
IF
ANY
OF
MY
KINSMEN
FIND
THEE
HERE.
ROMEO
WITH
LOVE'S
LIGHT
WINGS
DID
I
O'ER-PERCH
THESE
WALLS;
FOR
STONY
LIMITS
CANNOT
HOLD
LOVE
OUT,
AND
WHAT
LOVE
CAN
DO
THAT
DARES
LOVE
ATTEMPT;
THEREFORE
THY
KINSMEN
ARE
NO
LET
TO
ME.
JULIET
IF
THEY
DO
SEE
THEE,
THEY
WILL
MURDER
THEE.
ROMEO
ALACK,
THERE
LIES
MORE
PERIL
IN
THINE
EYE
THAN
TWENTY
OF
THEIR
SWORDS:
LOOK
THOU
BUT
SWEET,
AND
I
AM
PROOF
AGAINST
THEIR
ENMITY.
JULIET
I
WOULD
NOT
FOR
THE
WORLD
THEY
SAW
THEE
HERE.
ROMEO
I
HAVE
NIGHT'S
CLOAK
TO
HIDE
ME
FROM
THEIR
SIGHT;
AND
BUT
THOU
LOVE
ME,
LET
THEM
FIND
ME
HERE:
MY
LIFE
WERE
BETTER
ENDED
BY
THEIR
HATE,
THAN
DEATH
PROROGUED,
WANTING
OF
THY
LOVE.
JULIET
BY
WHOSE
DIRECTION
FOUND'ST
THOU
OUT
THIS
PLACE?
ROMEO
BY
LOVE,
WHO
FIRST
DID
PROMPT
ME
TO
INQUIRE;
HE
LENT
ME
COUNSEL
AND
I
LENT
HIM
EYES.
I
AM
NO
PILOT;
YET,
WERT
THOU
AS
FAR
AS
THAT
VAST
SHORE
WASH'D
WITH
THE
FARTHEST
SEA,
I
WOULD
ADVENTURE
FOR
SUCH
MERCHANDISE.
JULIET
THOU
KNOW'ST
THE
MASK
OF
NIGHT
IS
ON
MY
FACE,
ELSE
WOULD
A
MAIDEN
BLUSH
BEPAINT
MY
CHEEK
FOR
THAT
WHICH
THOU
HAST
HEARD
ME
SPEAK
TO-NIGHT
FAIN
WOULD
I
DWELL
ON
FORM,
FAIN,
FAIN
DENY
WHAT
I
HAVE
SPOKE:
BUT
FAREWELL
COMPLIMENT!
DOST
THOU
LOVE
ME?
I
KNOW
THOU
WILT
SAY
'AY,'
AND
I
WILL
TAKE
THY
WORD:
YET
IF
THOU
SWEAR'ST,
THOU
MAYST
PROVE
FALSE;
AT
LOVERS'
PERJURIES
THEN
SAY,
JOVE
LAUGHS.
O
GENTLE
ROMEO,
IF
THOU
DOST
LOVE,
PRONOUNCE
IT
FAITHFULLY:
OR
IF
THOU
THINK'ST
I
AM
TOO
QUICKLY
WON,
I'LL
FROWN
AND
BE
PERVERSE
AN
SAY
THEE
NAY,
SO
THOU
WILT
WOO;
BUT
ELSE,
NOT
FOR
THE
WORLD.
IN
TRUTH,
FAIR
MONTAGUE,
I
AM
TOO
FOND,
AND
THEREFORE
THOU
MAYST
THINK
MY
'HAVIOR
LIGHT:
BUT
TRUST
ME,
GENTLEMAN,
I'LL
PROVE
MORE
TRUE
THAN
THOSE
THAT
HAVE
MORE
CUNNING
TO
BE
STRANGE.
I
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MORE
STRANGE,
I
MUST
CONFESS,
BUT
THAT
THOU
OVERHEARD'ST,
ERE
I
WAS
WARE,
MY
TRUE
LOVE'S
PASSION:
THEREFORE
PARDON
ME,
AND
NOT
IMPUTE
THIS
YIELDING
TO
LIGHT
LOVE,
WHICH
THE
DARK
NIGHT
HATH
SO
DISCOVERED.
ROMEO
LADY,
BY
YONDER
BLESSED

I
SWEAR
THAT
TIPS
WITH

TOPS--
JULIET
O,
SWEAR
NOT
BY

THE
INCONSTANT
MOON,
THAT
MONTHLY
CHANGES
IN
HER
CIRCLED
ORB,
LEST
THAT
THY
LOVE
PROVE
LIKEWISE
VARIABLE.
ROMEO
WHAT
SHALL
I
SWEAR
BY?
JULIET
DO
NOT
SWEAR
AT
ALL;
OR,
IF
THOU
WILT,
SWEAR
BY
THY
GRACIOUS
SELF,
WHICH
IS
THE
GOD
OF
MY
IDOLATRY,
AND
I'LL
BELIEVE
THEE.
ROMEO
IF
MY

JULIET
WELL,
DO
NOT
SWEAR:
ALTHOUGH
I
JOY

THEE,
I
HAVE
NO
JOY
OF
THIS
CONTRACT
TO-NIGHT:
IT
IS
TOO
RASH,
TOO
UNADVISED,
TOO
SUDDEN;
TOO
LIKE
THE
LIGHTNING,
WHICH
DOTH
CEASE

BE
ERE
ONE
CAN
SAY
'IT
LIGHTENS.'
SWEET,
GOOD
NIGHT!
THIS
BUD
OF
LOVE,
BY
SUMMER'S
RIPENING
BREATH,
MAY
PROVE
A
BEAUTEOUS

WHEN
NEXT

GOOD

ROMEO

JULIET
WHAT
SATISFACTION
CANST
THOU
HAVE
TO-NIGHT?
ROMEO
THE

FAITHFUL

FOR
MINE.
JULIET
I
GAVE

THOU
DIDST
REQUEST
IT:

ROMEO
WOULDST
THOU
WITHDRAW
IT?
FOR
WHAT
PURPOSE,
LOVE?
JULIET
BUT
TO
BE
FRANK,
AND
GIVE
IT
THEE
AGAIN.
AND
YET
I
WISH
BUT
FOR
THE
THING
I
HAVE:
MY
BOUNTY
IS
AS
BOUNDLESS
AS
THE
SEA,
MY
LOVE
AS
DEEP;
THE
MORE
I
GIVE
TO
THEE,
THE
MORE

HAVE,
FOR
BOTH
ARE
INFINITE.

GOOD

ECHO

HOW

ROMEO

JULIET
I
WILL
NOT
FAIL:
'TIS
TWENTY
YEARS

I

FORGOT
WHY
I
DID
CALL
THEE

ROMEO
LET

JULIET
I
SHALL

STILL
STAND
THERE,
REMEMBERING
HOW
I
LOVE
THY

ROMEO
AND
I'LL

JULIET
'TIS

WHO

HOP
A

LIKE
A
POOR
PRISONER
IN
HIS
TWISTED
GYVES,
AND
WITH
A
SILK
THREAD
PLUCKS
IT
BACK
AGAIN,
SO
LOVING-JEALOUS
OF
HIS
LIBERTY.
ROMEO
I
WOULD
I
WERE
THY
BIRD.
JULIET
SWEET,
SO
WOULD
I:
YET
I
SHOULD
KILL
THEE
WITH
MUCH
CHERISHING.
GOOD
NIGHT,
GOOD

PARTING
IS
SUCH
SWEET
SORROW,
THAT
I
SHALL
SAY
GOOD

TILL

MORROW.

DWELL

BE?
CAME
HE
NOT
HOME
TO-NIGHT?
BENVOLIO
NOT
TO
HIS
FATHER'S;
I
SPOKE
WITH
HIS
MAN.
MERCUTIO
AH,
THAT
SAME
PALE
HARD-HEARTED
WENCH,
THAT
ROSALINE.
TORMENTS
HIM
SO,
THAT
HE
WILL
SURE
RUN
MAD.
BENVOLIO
TYBALT,
THE
KINSMAN
OF
OLD
CAPULET,
HATH
SENT
A
LETTER
TO
HIS
FATHER'S
HOUSE.
MERCUTIO
A
CHALLENGE,
ON
MY
LIFE.
BENVOLIO
ROMEO
WILL
ANSWER
IT.
MERCUTIO
ANY
MAN
THAT
CAN
WRITE
MAY
ANSWER
A
LETTER.
BENVOLIO
NAY,
HE
WILL
ANSWER
THE
LETTER'S
MASTER,
HOW
HE
DARES,
BEING
DARED.
MERCUTIO
ALAS
POOR
ROMEO!
HE
IS
ALREADY
DEAD;
STABBED
WITH
A
WHITE
WENCH'S
BLACK
EYE;
SHOT
THROUGH
THE
EAR
WITH
A
LOVE-SONG;
THE
VERY
PIN
OF
HIS
HEART
CLEFT
WITH
THE
BLIND
BOW-BOY'S
BUTT-SHAFT:
AND
IS
HE
A
MAN
TO
ENCOUNTER
TYBALT?
BENVOLIO
WHY,
WHAT
IS
TYBALT?
MERCUTIO
MORE
THAN
PRINCE
OF
CATS,
I
CAN
TELL
YOU.
O,
HE
IS
THE
COURAGEOUS
CAPTAIN
OF
COMPLIMENTS.
HE
FIGHTS
AS
YOU
SING
PRICK-SONG,
KEEPS
TIME,
DISTANCE,
AND
PROPORTION;
RESTS
ME
HIS
MINIM
REST,
ONE,
TWO,
AND
THE
THIRD
IN
YOUR
BOSOM:
THE
VERY
BUTCHER
OF
A
SILK
BUTTON,
A
DUELLIST,
A
DUELLIST;
A
GENTLEMAN
OF
THE
VERY
FIRST
HOUSE,
OF
THE
FIRST
AND
SECOND
CAUSE:
AH,
THE
IMMORTAL
PASSADO!
THE
PUNTO
REVERSO!
THE
HAI!
BENVOLIO
THE
WHAT?
MERCUTIO
THE
POX
OF
SUCH
ANTIC,
LISPING,
AFFECTING
FANTASTICOES;
THESE
NEW
TUNERS
OF
ACCENTS!
'BY
JESU,
A
VERY
GOOD
BLADE!
A
VERY
TALL
MAN!
A
VERY
GOOD
WHORE!'
WHY,
IS
NOT
THIS
A
LAMENTABLE
THING,
GRANDSIRE,
THAT
WE
SHOULD
BE
THUS
AFFLICTED
WITH
THESE
STRANGE
FLIES,
THESE
FASHION-MONGERS,
THESE
PERDONA-MI'S,
WHO
STAND
SO
MUCH
ON
THE
NEW
FORM,
THAT
THEY
CANNOT
AT
EASE
ON
THE
OLD
BENCH?
O,
THEIR
BONES,
THEIR
BONES!
ENTER
ROMEO

BENVOLIO
HERE
COMES
ROMEO,
HERE
COMES
ROMEO.
MERCUTIO
WITHOUT
HIS
ROE,
LIKE
A
DRIED
HERRING:
FLESH,
FLESH,
HOW
ART
THOU
FISHIFIED!
NOW
IS
HE
FOR
THE
NUMBERS
THAT
PETRARCH
FLOWED
IN:
LAURA
TO
HIS
LADY
WAS
BUT
A
KITCHEN-WENCH;
MARRY,
SHE
HAD
A
BETTER
LOVE
TO
BE-RHYME
HER;
DIDO
A
DOWDY;
CLEOPATRA
A
GIPSY;
HELEN
AND
HERO
HILDINGS
AND
HARLOTS;
THISBE
A
GREY
EYE
OR
SO,
BUT
NOT
TO
THE
PURPOSE.
SIGNIOR
ROMEO,
BON
JOUR!
THERE'S
A
FRENCH
SALUTATION
TO
YOUR
FRENCH
SLOP.
YOU
GAVE
US
THE
COUNTERFEIT
FAIRLY
LAST
NIGHT.
ROMEO
GOOD
MORROW
TO
YOU
BOTH.
WHAT
COUNTERFEIT
DID
I
GIVE
YOU?
MERCUTIO
THE
SHIP,
SIR,
THE
SLIP;
CAN
YOU
NOT
CONCEIVE?
ROMEO
PARDON,
GOOD
MERCUTIO,
MY
BUSINESS
WAS
GREAT;
AND
IN
SUCH
A
CASE
AS
MINE
A
MAN
MAY
STRAIN
COURTESY.
MERCUTIO
THAT'S
AS
MUCH
AS
TO
SAY,
SUCH
A
CASE
AS
YOURS
CONSTRAINS
A
MAN
TO
BOW
IN
THE
HAMS.
ROMEO
MEANING,
TO
COURT'SY.
MERCUTIO
THOU
HAST
MOST
KINDLY
HIT
IT.
ROMEO
A
MOST
COURTEOUS
EXPOSITION.
MERCUTIO
NAY,
I
AM
THE
VERY
PINK
OF
COURTESY.
ROMEO
PINK
FOR
FLOWER.
MERCUTIO
RIGHT.
ROMEO
WHY,
THEN
IS
MY
PUMP
WELL
FLOWERED.
MERCUTIO
WELL
SAID:
FOLLOW
ME
THIS
JEST
NOW
TILL
THOU
HAST
WORN
OUT
THY
PUMP,
THAT
WHEN
THE
SINGLE
SOLE
OF
IT
IS
WORN,
THE
JEST
MAY
REMAIN
AFTER
THE
WEARING
SOLE
SINGULAR.
ROMEO
O
SINGLE-SOLED
JEST,
SOLELY
SINGULAR
FOR
THE
SINGLENESS.
MERCUTIO
COME
BETWEEN
US,
GOOD
BENVOLIO;
MY
WITS
FAINT.
ROMEO
SWITCH
AND
SPURS,
SWITCH
AND
SPURS;
OR
I'LL
CRY
A
MATCH.
MERCUTIO
NAY,
IF
THY
WITS
RUN
THE
WILD-GOOSE
CHASE,
I
HAVE
DONE,
FOR
THOU
HAST
MORE
OF
THE
WILD-GOOSE
IN
ONE
OF
THY
WITS
THAN,
I
AM
SURE,
I
HAVE
IN
MY
WHOLE
FIVE:
WAS
I
WITH
YOU
THERE
FOR
THE
GOOSE?
ROMEO
THOU
WAST
NEVER
WITH
ME
FOR
ANY
THING
WHEN
THOU
WAST
NOT
THERE
FOR
THE
GOOSE.
MERCUTIO
I
WILL
BITE
THEE
BY
THE
EAR
FOR
THAT
JEST.
ROMEO
NAY,
GOOD
GOOSE,
BITE
NOT.
MERCUTIO
THY
WIT
IS
A
VERY
BITTER
SWEETING;
IT
IS
A
MOST
SHARP
SAUCE.
ROMEO
AND
IS
IT
NOT
WELL
SERVED
IN
TO
A
SWEET
GOOSE?
MERCUTIO
O
HERE'S
A
WIT
OF
CHEVERIL,
THAT
STRETCHES
FROM
AN
INCH
NARROW
TO
AN
ELL
BROAD!
ROMEO
I
STRETCH
IT
OUT
FOR
THAT
WORD
'BROAD;'
WHICH
ADDED
TO
THE
GOOSE,
PROVES
THEE
FAR
AND
WIDE
A
BROAD
GOOSE.
MERCUTIO
WHY,
IS
NOT
THIS
BETTER
NOW
THAN
GROANING
FOR
LOVE?
NOW
ART
THOU
SOCIABLE,
NOW
ART
THOU
ROMEO;
NOW
ART
THOU
WHAT
THOU
ART,
BY
ART
AS
WELL
AS
BY
NATURE:
FOR
THIS
DRIVELLING
LOVE
IS
LIKE
A
GREAT
NATURAL,
THAT
RUNS
LOLLING
UP
AND
DOWN
TO
HIDE
HIS
BAUBLE
IN
A
HOLE.
BENVOLIO
STOP
THERE,
STOP
THERE.
MERCUTIO
THOU
DESIREST
ME
TO
STOP
IN
MY
TALE
AGAINST
THE
HAIR.
BENVOLIO
THOU
WOULDST
ELSE
HAVE
MADE
THY
TALE
LARGE.
MERCUTIO
O,
THOU
ART
DECEIVED;
I
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
IT
SHORT:
FOR
I
WAS
COME
TO
THE
WHOLE
DEPTH
OF
MY
TALE;
AND
MEANT,
INDEED,
TO
OCCUPY
THE
ARGUMENT
NO
LONGER.
ROMEO
HERE'S
GOODLY
GEAR!
ENTER
NURSE

HIMSELF

MAR,'
QUOTH
A'?
GENTLEMEN,
CAN
ANY
OF
YOU
TELL
ME
WHERE
I
MAY
FIND
THE
YOUNG
ROMEO?
ROMEO
I
CAN
TELL
YOU;
BUT
YOUNG
ROMEO
WILL
BE
OLDER
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
FOUND
HIM
THAN
HE
WAS
WHEN
YOU
SOUGHT
HIM:
I
AM
THE
YOUNGEST
OF
THAT
NAME,
FOR
FAULT
OF
A
WORSE.
NURSE
YOU
SAY
WELL.
MERCUTIO
YEA,

WORST
WELL?
VERY
WELL
TOOK,

NURSE
IF

DESIRE
SOME
CONFIDENCE
WITH

BENVOLIO
SHE

INDITE

TO
SOME
SUPPER.
MERCUTIO
A
BAWD,
A
BAWD,
A
BAWD!
SO
HO!
ROMEO
WHAT
HAST
THOU
FOUND?
MERCUTIO
NO
HARE,
SIR;
UNLESS
A
HARE,
SIR,
IN
A
LENTEN
PIE,
THAT
IS
SOMETHING
STALE
AND
HOAR
ERE

SPENT.
SINGS

AN

HOAR,
AND
AN

BUT
A
HARE

IS
TOO
MUCH
FOR
A

ROMEO,
WILL

COME

YOUR
FATHER'S?
WE'LL

WILL
FOLLOW
YOU.
MERCUTIO

NURSE
MARRY,
FAREWELL!
I
PRAY
YOU,
SIR,
WHAT
SAUCY
MERCHANT
WAS
THIS,
THAT
WAS
SO
FULL
OF
HIS
ROPERY?
ROMEO
A
GENTLEMAN,
NURSE,
THAT
LOVES
TO
HEAR
HIMSELF
TALK,
AND
WILL
SPEAK
MORE
IN
A
MINUTE
THAN
HE
WILL
STAND
TO
IN
A
MONTH.
NURSE

SPEAK
ANY
THING
AGAINST
ME,
I'LL
TAKE
HIM
DOWN,

AND

JACKS;
AND
IF
I
CANNOT,
I'LL
FIND
THOSE

SCURVY
KNAVE!
I
AM
NONE
OF
HIS
FLIRT-GILLS;
I
AM
NONE
OF
HIS
SKAINS-MATES.
AND
THOU
MUST
STAND
BY
TOO,
AND
SUFFER
EVERY
KNAVE
TO
USE
ME
AT
HIS
PLEASURE?
PETER
I
SAW
NO
MAN
USE
YOU
A
PLEASURE;
IF
I
HAD,
MY
WEAPON
SHOULD
QUICKLY
HAVE
BEEN
OUT,
I
WARRANT
YOU:
I
DARE
DRAW
AS
SOON
AS
ANOTHER
MAN,
IF
I

OCCASION
IN
A
GOOD
QUARREL,
AND

NURSE

AFORE

I

PRAY

MY
YOUNG
LADY
BADE
ME
INQUIRE
YOU

WHAT
SHE
BADE

SAY,
I
WILL
KEEP
TO
MYSELF:
BUT
FIRST
LET
ME
TELL
YE,
IF
YE
SHOULD
LEAD
HER
INTO
A
FOOL'S
PARADISE,
AS
THEY
SAY,
IT
WERE
A
VERY
GROSS
KIND
OF
BEHAVIOR,
AS
THEY
SAY:
FOR
THE
GENTLEWOMAN
IS
YOUNG;
AND,
THEREFORE,
IF
YOU
SHOULD
DEAL
DOUBLE
WITH
HER,
TRULY
IT
WERE
AN
ILL
THING
TO
BE
OFFERED
TO
ANY
GENTLEWOMAN,
AND
VERY
WEAK
DEALING.
ROMEO
NURSE,
COMMEND
ME
TO

A
JOYFUL
WOMAN.
ROMEO
WHAT
WILT
THOU
TELL
HER,
NURSE?
THOU
DOST
NOT
MARK
ME.
NURSE
I
WILL
TELL
HER,
SIR,
THAT
YOU

PROTEST;
WHICH,
AS
I
TAKE
IT,
IS
A
GENTLEMANLIKE
OFFER.
ROMEO
BID

DEVISE
SOME
MEANS
TO
COME
TO
SHRIFT

AFTERNOON;
AND

TACKLED
STAIR;
WHICH

MUST
BE
MY

FAREWELL;
BE

NURSE
AH.

PERCHANCE
SHE

HIM:
THAT'S

O,

SHOULD
BE

WHICH
TEN

BY

WHEN
THOU

THE

A
MAN:
ROMEO!
NO,
NOT
HE;
THOUGH
HIS
FACE
BE
BETTER
THAN
ANY
MAN'S,
YET
HIS
LEG
EXCELS
ALL
MEN'S;
AND
FOR
A
HAND,
AND
A
FOOT,
AND
A
BODY,
THOUGH
THEY
BE
NOT

TALKED
ON,
YET
THEY
ARE
PAST
COMPARE:
HE

TO
DO
THEIR
AMOROUS
RITES
BY
THEIR
OWN
BEAUTIES;
OR,
IF
LOVE
BE
BLIND,
IT
BEST
AGREES
WITH
NIGHT.
COME,
CIVIL
NIGHT,
THOU
SOBER-SUITED
MATRON,
ALL
IN
BLACK,
AND
LEARN
ME
HOW
TO
LOSE
A
WINNING
MATCH,
PLAY'D
FOR
A
PAIR
OF
STAINLESS
MAIDENHOODS:
HOOD
MY
UNMANN'D
BLOOD,
BATING
IN
MY
CHEEKS,
WITH
THY
BLACK
MANTLE;
TILL
STRANGE
LOVE,
GROWN
BOLD,
THINK
TRUE
LOVE
ACTED
SIMPLE
MODESTY.
COME,
NIGHT;
COME,
ROMEO;
COME,
THOU
DAY
IN
NIGHT;
FOR
THOU
WILT
LIE
UPON
THE
WINGS
OF
NIGHT
WHITER
THAN
NEW
SNOW
ON
A
RAVEN'S
BACK.
COME,
GENTLE
NIGHT,
COME,
LOVING,
BLACK-BROW'D
NIGHT,
GIVE
ME
MY
ROMEO;
AND,
WHEN
HE
SHALL
DIE,
TAKE
HIM
AND
CUT
HIM
OUT
IN
LITTLE
STARS,
AND
HE
WILL
MAKE
THE
FACE
OF
HEAVEN
SO
FINE
THAT
ALL
THE
WORLD
WILL
BE
IN
LOVE
WITH
NIGHT
AND
PAY
NO
WORSHIP
TO
THE
GARISH
SUN.
O,
I
HAVE
BOUGHT
THE
MANSION
OF
A
LOVE,
BUT
NOT
POSSESS'D
IT,
AND,
THOUGH
I
AM
SOLD,
NOT
YET
ENJOY'D:
SO
TEDIOUS
IS
THIS
DAY
AS
IS
THE
NIGHT
BEFORE
SOME
FESTIVAL
TO
AN
IMPATIENT
CHILD
THAT
HATH
NEW
ROBES
AND
MAY
NOT
WEAR
THEM.
O,
HERE
COMES
MY
NURSE,
AND
SHE
BRINGS
NEWS;
AND
EVERY
TONGUE
THAT
SPEAKS
BUT
ROMEO'S
NAME
SPEAKS
HEAVENLY
ELOQUENCE.
ENTER
NURSE,
WITH
CORDS

NOW,
NURSE,
WHAT
NEWS?
WHAT
HAST
THOU
THERE?
THE
CORDS
THAT
ROMEO
BID
THEE
FETCH?
NURSE
AY,
AY,
THE
CORDS.
THROWS
THEM
DOWN

JULIET
AY
ME!
WHAT
NEWS?
WHY
DOST
THOU
WRING
THY
HANDS?
NURSE
AH,
WELL-A-DAY!
HE'S
DEAD,
HE'S
DEAD,
HE'S
DEAD!
WE
ARE
UNDONE,
LADY,
WE
ARE
UNDONE!
ALACK
THE
DAY!
HE'S
GONE,
HE'S
KILL'D,
HE'S
DEAD!
JULIET
CAN
HEAVEN
BE
SO
ENVIOUS?
NURSE
ROMEO
CAN,
THOUGH
HEAVEN
CANNOT:
O
ROMEO,
ROMEO!
WHO
EVER
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
IT?
ROMEO!
JULIET
WHAT
DEVIL
ART
THOU,
THAT
DOST
TORMENT
ME
THUS?
THIS
TORTURE
SHOULD
BE
ROAR'D
IN
DISMAL
HELL.
HATH
ROMEO
SLAIN
HIMSELF?
SAY
THOU
BUT
'I,'
AND
THAT
BARE
VOWEL
'I'
SHALL
POISON
MORE
THAN
THE
DEATH-DARTING
EYE
OF
COCKATRICE:
I
AM
NOT
I,
IF
THERE
BE
SUCH
AN
I;
OR
THOSE
EYES
SHUT,
THAT
MAKE
THEE
ANSWER
'I.'
IF
HE
BE
SLAIN,
SAY
'I';
OR
IF
NOT,
NO:
BRIEF
SOUNDS
DETERMINE
OF
MY
WEAL
OR
WOE.
NURSE
I
SAW
THE
WOUND,
I
SAW
IT
WITH
MINE
EYES,--
GOD
SAVE
THE
MARK!--HERE
ON
HIS
MANLY
BREAST:
A
PITEOUS
CORSE,
A
BLOODY
PITEOUS
CORSE;
PALE,
PALE
AS
ASHES,
ALL
BEDAUB'D
IN
BLOOD,
ALL
IN
GORE-BLOOD;
I
SWOUNDED
AT
THE
SIGHT.
JULIET
O,
BREAK,
MY
HEART!
POOR
BANKRUPT,
BREAK
AT
ONCE!
TO
PRISON,
EYES,
NE'ER
LOOK
ON
LIBERTY!
VILE
EARTH,
TO
EARTH
RESIGN;
END
MOTION
HERE;
AND
THOU
AND
ROMEO
PRESS
ONE
HEAVY
BIER!
NURSE
O
TYBALT,
TYBALT,
THE
BEST
FRIEND
I
HAD!
O
COURTEOUS
TYBALT!
HONEST
GENTLEMAN!
THAT
EVER
I
SHOULD
LIVE
TO
SEE
THEE
DEAD!
JULIET
WHAT
STORM
IS
THIS
THAT
BLOWS
SO
CONTRARY?
IS
ROMEO
SLAUGHTER'D,
AND
IS
TYBALT
DEAD?
MY
DEAR-LOVED
COUSIN,
AND
MY
DEARER
LORD?
THEN,
DREADFUL
TRUMPET,
SOUND
THE
GENERAL
DOOM!
FOR
WHO
IS
LIVING,
IF
THOSE
TWO
ARE
GONE?
NURSE
TYBALT
IS
GONE,
AND
ROMEO
BANISHED;
ROMEO
THAT
KILL'D
HIM,
HE
IS
BANISHED.
JULIET
O
GOD!
DID
ROMEO'S
HAND
SHED
TYBALT'S
BLOOD?
NURSE
IT
DID,
IT
DID;
ALAS
THE
DAY,
IT
DID!
JULIET
O
SERPENT
HEART,
HID
WITH
A
FLOWERING
FACE!
DID
EVER
DRAGON
KEEP
SO
FAIR
A
CAVE?
BEAUTIFUL
TYRANT!
FIEND
ANGELICAL!
DOVE-FEATHER'D
RAVEN!
WOLVISH-RAVENING
LAMB!
DESPISED
SUBSTANCE
OF
DIVINEST
SHOW!
JUST
OPPOSITE
TO
WHAT
THOU
JUSTLY
SEEM'ST,
A
DAMNED
SAINT,
AN
HONOURABLE
VILLAIN!
O
NATURE,
WHAT
HADST
THOU
TO
DO
IN
HELL,
WHEN
THOU
DIDST
BOWER
THE
SPIRIT
OF
A
FIEND
IN
MORAL
PARADISE
OF
SUCH
SWEET
FLESH?
WAS
EVER
BOOK
CONTAINING
SUCH
VILE
MATTER
SO
FAIRLY
BOUND?
O
THAT
DECEIT
SHOULD
DWELL
IN
SUCH
A
GORGEOUS
PALACE!
NURSE
THERE'S
NO
TRUST,
NO
FAITH,
NO
HONESTY
IN
MEN;
ALL
PERJURED,
ALL
FORSWORN,
ALL
NAUGHT,
ALL
DISSEMBLERS.
AH,
WHERE'S
MY
MAN?
GIVE
ME
SOME
AQUA
VITAE:
THESE
GRIEFS,
THESE
WOES,
THESE
SORROWS
MAKE
ME
OLD.
SHAME
COME
TO
ROMEO!
JULIET
BLISTER'D
BE
THY
TONGUE
FOR
SUCH
A
WISH!
HE
WAS
NOT
BORN
TO
SHAME:
UPON
HIS
BROW
SHAME
IS
ASHAMED
TO
SIT;
FOR
'TIS
A
THRONE
WHERE
HONOUR
MAY
BE
CROWN'D
SOLE
MONARCH
OF
THE
UNIVERSAL
EARTH.
O,
WHAT
A
BEAST
WAS
I
TO
CHIDE
AT
HIM!
NURSE
WILL
YOU
SPEAK
WELL
OF
HIM
THAT
KILL'D
YOUR
COUSIN?
JULIET
SHALL
I
SPEAK
ILL
OF
HIM
THAT
IS
MY
HUSBAND?
AH,
POOR
MY
LORD,
WHAT
TONGUE
SHALL
SMOOTH
THY
NAME,
WHEN
I,
THY
THREE-HOURS
WIFE,
HAVE
MANGLED
IT?
BUT,
WHEREFORE,
VILLAIN,
DIDST
THOU
KILL
MY
COUSIN?
THAT
VILLAIN
COUSIN
WOULD
HAVE
KILL'D
MY
HUSBAND:
BACK,
FOOLISH
TEARS,
BACK
TO
YOUR
NATIVE
SPRING;
YOUR
TRIBUTARY
DROPS
BELONG
TO
WOE,
WHICH
YOU,
MISTAKING,
OFFER
UP
TO
JOY.
MY
HUSBAND
LIVES,
THAT
TYBALT
WOULD
HAVE
SLAIN;
AND
TYBALT'S
DEAD,
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
SLAIN
MY
HUSBAND:
ALL
THIS
IS
COMFORT;
WHEREFORE
WEEP
I
THEN?
SOME
WORD
THERE
WAS,
WORSER
THAN
TYBALT'S
DEATH,
THAT
MURDER'D
ME:
I
WOULD
FORGET
IT
FAIN;
BUT,
O,
IT
PRESSES
TO
MY
MEMORY,
LIKE
DAMNED
GUILTY
DEEDS
TO
SINNERS'
MINDS:
'TYBALT
IS
DEAD,
AND
ROMEO--BANISHED;'
THAT
'BANISHED,'
THAT
ONE
WORD
'BANISHED,'
HATH
SLAIN
TEN
THOUSAND
TYBALTS.
TYBALT'S
DEATH
WAS
WOE
ENOUGH,
IF
IT
HAD
ENDED
THERE:
OR,
IF
SOUR
WOE
DELIGHTS
IN
FELLOWSHIP
AND
NEEDLY
WILL
BE
RANK'D
WITH
OTHER
GRIEFS,
WHY
FOLLOW'D
NOT,
WHEN
SHE
SAID
'TYBALT'S
DEAD,'
THY
FATHER,
OR
THY
MOTHER,
NAY,
OR
BOTH,
WHICH
MODERN
LAMENTATIONS
MIGHT
HAVE
MOVED?
BUT
WITH
A
REAR-WARD
FOLLOWING
TYBALT'S
DEATH,
'ROMEO
IS
BANISHED,'
TO
SPEAK
THAT
WORD,
IS
FATHER,
MOTHER,
TYBALT,
ROMEO,
JULIET,
ALL
SLAIN,
ALL
DEAD.
'ROMEO
IS
BANISHED!'
THERE
IS
NO
END,
NO
LIMIT,
MEASURE,
BOUND,
IN
THAT
WORD'S
DEATH;
NO
WORDS
CAN
THAT
WOE
SOUND.
WHERE
IS
MY
FATHER,
AND
MY
MOTHER,
NURSE?
NURSE
WEEPING
AND
WAILING
OVER
TYBALT'S
CORSE:
WILL
YOU
GO
TO
THEM?
I
WILL
BRING
YOU
THITHER.
JULIET
WASH
THEY
HIS
WOUNDS
WITH
TEARS:
MINE
SHALL
BE
SPENT,
WHEN
THEIRS
ARE
DRY,
FOR
ROMEO'S
BANISHMENT.
TAKE
UP
THOSE
CORDS:
POOR
ROPES,
YOU
ARE
BEGUILED,
BOTH
YOU
AND
I;
FOR
ROMEO
IS
EXILED:
HE
MADE
YOU
FOR
A
HIGHWAY
TO
MY
BED;
BUT
I,
A
MAID,
DIE
MAIDEN-WIDOWED.
COME,
CORDS,
COME,
NURSE;
I'LL
TO
MY
WEDDING-BED;
AND
DEATH,
NOT
ROMEO,
TAKE
MY
MAIDENHEAD!
NURSE
HIE
TO
YOUR
CHAMBER:
I'LL
FIND
ROMEO
TO
COMFORT
YOU:
I
WOT
WELL
WHERE
HE
IS.
HARK
YE,
YOUR
ROMEO
WILL
BE
HERE
AT
NIGHT:
I'LL
TO
HIM;
HE
IS
HID
AT
LAURENCE'
CELL.
JULIET
O,
FIND
HIM!
GIVE
THIS
RING
TO
MY
TRUE
KNIGHT,
AND
BID
HIM
COME
TO
TAKE
HIS
LAST
FAREWELL.
EXEUNT

SCENE

FRIAR
LAURENCE'S
CELL.
ENTER
FRIAR
LAURENCE
FRIAR
LAURENCE
ROMEO,
COME
FORTH;
COME
FORTH,
THOU
FEARFUL
MAN:
AFFLICTION
IS
ENAMOUR'D
OF
THY
PARTS,
AND
THOU
ART
WEDDED
TO
CALAMITY.
ENTER
ROMEO

ROMEO
FATHER,
WHAT
NEWS?
WHAT
IS
THE
PRINCE'S
DOOM?
WHAT
SORROW
CRAVES
ACQUAINTANCE
AT
MY
HAND,
THAT
I
YET
KNOW
NOT?
FRIAR
LAURENCE
TOO
FAMILIAR
IS
MY
DEAR
SON
WITH
SUCH
SOUR
COMPANY:
I
BRING
THEE
TIDINGS
OF
THE
PRINCE'S
DOOM.
ROMEO
WHAT
LESS
THAN
DOOMS-DAY
IS
THE
PRINCE'S
DOOM?
FRIAR
LAURENCE
A
GENTLER
JUDGMENT
VANISH'D
FROM
HIS
LIPS,
NOT
BODY'S
DEATH,
BUT
BODY'S
BANISHMENT.
ROMEO
HA,
BANISHMENT!
BE
MERCIFUL,
SAY
'DEATH;'
FOR
EXILE
HATH
MORE
TERROR
IN
HIS
LOOK,
MUCH
MORE
THAN
DEATH:
DO
NOT
SAY
'BANISHMENT.'
FRIAR
LAURENCE
HENCE
FROM
VERONA
ART
THOU
BANISHED:
BE
PATIENT,
FOR
THE
WORLD
IS
BROAD
AND
WIDE.
ROMEO
THERE
IS
NO
WORLD
WITHOUT
VERONA
WALLS,
BUT
PURGATORY,
TORTURE,
HELL
ITSELF.
HENCE-BANISHED
IS
BANISH'D
FROM
THE
WORLD,
AND
WORLD'S
EXILE
IS
DEATH:
THEN
BANISHED,
IS
DEATH
MIS-TERM'D:
CALLING
DEATH
BANISHMENT,
THOU
CUTT'ST
MY
HEAD
OFF
WITH
A
GOLDEN
AXE,
AND
SMILEST
UPON
THE
STROKE
THAT
MURDERS
ME.
FRIAR
LAURENCE
O
DEADLY
SIN!
O
RUDE
UNTHANKFULNESS!
THY
FAULT
OUR
LAW
CALLS
DEATH;
BUT
THE
KIND
PRINCE,
TAKING
THY
PART,
HATH
RUSH'D
ASIDE
THE
LAW,
AND
TURN'D
THAT
BLACK
WORD
DEATH
TO
BANISHMENT:
THIS
IS
DEAR
MERCY,
AND
THOU
SEEST
IT
NOT.
ROMEO
'TIS
TORTURE,
AND
NOT
MERCY:
HEAVEN
IS
HERE,
WHERE
JULIET
LIVES;
AND
EVERY
CAT
AND
DOG
AND
LITTLE
MOUSE,
EVERY
UNWORTHY
THING,
LIVE
HERE
IN
HEAVEN
AND
MAY
LOOK
ON
HER;
BUT
ROMEO
MAY
NOT:
MORE
VALIDITY,
MORE
HONOURABLE
STATE,
MORE
COURTSHIP
LIVES
IN
CARRION-FLIES
THAN
ROMEO:
THEY
MY
SEIZE
ON
THE
WHITE
WONDER
OF
DEAR
JULIET'S
HAND
AND
STEAL
IMMORTAL
BLESSING
FROM
HER
LIPS,
WHO
EVEN
IN
PURE
AND
VESTAL
MODESTY,
STILL
BLUSH,
AS
THINKING
THEIR
OWN
KISSES
SIN;
BUT
ROMEO
MAY
NOT;
HE
IS
BANISHED:
FLIES
MAY
DO
THIS,
BUT
I
FROM
THIS
MUST
FLY:
THEY
ARE
FREE
MEN,
BUT
I
AM
BANISHED.
AND
SAY'ST
THOU
YET
THAT
EXILE
IS
NOT
DEATH?
HADST
THOU
NO
POISON
MIX'D,
NO
SHARP-GROUND
KNIFE,
NO
SUDDEN
MEAN
OF
DEATH,
THOUGH
NE'ER
SO
MEAN,
BUT
'BANISHED'
TO
KILL
ME?--'BANISHED'?
O
FRIAR,
THE
DAMNED
USE
THAT
WORD
IN
HELL;
HOWLINGS
ATTEND
IT:
HOW
HAST
THOU
THE
HEART,
BEING
A
DIVINE,
A
GHOSTLY
CONFESSOR,
A
SIN-ABSOLVER,
AND
MY
FRIEND
PROFESS'D,
TO
MANGLE
ME
WITH
THAT
WORD
'BANISHED'?
FRIAR
LAURENCE
THOU
FOND
MAD
MAN,
HEAR
ME
BUT
SPEAK
A
WORD.
ROMEO
O,
THOU
WILT
SPEAK
AGAIN
OF
BANISHMENT.
FRIAR
LAURENCE
I'LL
GIVE
THEE
ARMOUR
TO
KEEP
OFF
THAT
WORD:
ADVERSITY'S
SWEET
MILK,
PHILOSOPHY,
TO
COMFORT
THEE,
THOUGH
THOU
ART
BANISHED.
ROMEO
YET
'BANISHED'?
HANG
UP
PHILOSOPHY!
UNLESS
PHILOSOPHY
CAN
MAKE
A
JULIET,
DISPLANT
A
TOWN,
REVERSE
A
PRINCE'S
DOOM,
IT
HELPS
NOT,
IT
PREVAILS
NOT:
TALK
NO
MORE.
FRIAR
LAURENCE
O,
THEN
I
SEE
THAT
MADMEN
HAVE
NO
EARS.
ROMEO
HOW
SHOULD
THEY,
WHEN
THAT
WISE
MEN
HAVE
NO
EYES?
FRIAR
LAURENCE
LET
ME
DISPUTE
WITH
THEE
OF
THY
ESTATE.
ROMEO
THOU
CANST
NOT
SPEAK
OF
THAT
THOU
DOST
NOT
FEEL:
WERT
THOU
AS
YOUNG
AS
I,
JULIET
THY
LOVE,
AN
HOUR
BUT
MARRIED,
TYBALT
MURDERED,
DOTING
LIKE
ME
AND
LIKE
ME
BANISHED,
THEN
MIGHTST
THOU
SPEAK,
THEN
MIGHTST
THOU
TEAR
THY
HAIR,
AND
FALL
UPON
THE
GROUND,
AS
I
DO
NOW,
TAKING
THE
MEASURE
OF
AN
UNMADE
GRAVE.
KNOCKING
WITHIN

FRIAR
LAURENCE
ARISE;
ONE
KNOCKS;
GOOD
ROMEO,
HIDE
THYSELF.
ROMEO
NOT
I;
UNLESS
THE
BREATH
OF
HEARTSICK
GROANS,
MIST-LIKE,
INFOLD
ME
FROM
THE
SEARCH
OF
EYES.
KNOCKING

FRIAR
LAURENCE
HARK,
HOW
THEY
KNOCK!
WHO'S
THERE?
ROMEO,
ARISE;
THOU
WILT
BE
TAKEN.
STAY
AWHILE!
STAND
UP;
KNOCKING

RUN
TO
MY
STUDY.
BY
AND
BY!
GOD'S
WILL,
WHAT
SIMPLENESS
IS
THIS!
I
COME,
I
COME!
KNOCKING

WHO
KNOCKS
SO
HARD?
WHENCE
COME
YOU?
WHAT'S
YOUR
WILL?
NURSE
[WITHIN]
LET
ME
COME
IN,
AND
YOU
SHALL
KNOW
MY
ERRAND;
I
COME
FROM
LADY
JULIET.
FRIAR
LAURENCE
WELCOME,
THEN.
ENTER
NURSE

NURSE
O
HOLY
FRIAR,
O,
TELL
ME,
HOLY
FRIAR,
WHERE
IS
MY
LADY'S
LORD,
WHERE'S
ROMEO?
FRIAR
LAURENCE
THERE
ON
THE
GROUND,
WITH
HIS
OWN
TEARS
MADE
DRUNK.
NURSE
O,
HE
IS
EVEN
IN
MY
MISTRESS'
CASE,
JUST
IN
HER
CASE!
O
WOFUL
SYMPATHY!
PITEOUS
PREDICAMENT!
EVEN
SO
LIES
SHE,
BLUBBERING
AND
WEEPING,
WEEPING
AND
BLUBBERING.
STAND
UP,
STAND
UP;
STAND,
AND
YOU
BE
A
MAN:
FOR
JULIET'S
SAKE,
FOR
HER
SAKE,
RISE
AND
STAND;
WHY
SHOULD
YOU
FALL
INTO
SO
DEEP
AN
O?
ROMEO
NURSE!
NURSE
AH
SIR!
AH
SIR!
WELL,
DEATH'S
THE
END
OF
ALL.
ROMEO
SPAKEST
THOU
OF
JULIET?
HOW
IS
IT
WITH
HER?
DOTH
SHE
NOT
THINK
ME
AN
OLD
MURDERER,
NOW
I
HAVE
STAIN'D
THE
CHILDHOOD
OF
OUR
JOY
WITH
BLOOD
REMOVED
BUT
LITTLE
FROM
HER
OWN?
WHERE
IS
SHE?
AND
HOW
DOTH
SHE?
AND
WHAT
SAYS
MY
CONCEAL'D
LADY
TO
OUR
CANCELL'D
LOVE?
NURSE
O,
SHE
SAYS
NOTHING,
SIR,
BUT
WEEPS
AND
WEEPS;
AND
NOW
FALLS
ON
HER
BED;
AND
THEN
STARTS
UP,
AND
TYBALT
CALLS;
AND
THEN
ON
ROMEO
CRIES,
AND
THEN
DOWN
FALLS
AGAIN.
ROMEO
AS
IF
THAT
NAME,
SHOT
FROM
THE
DEADLY
LEVEL
OF
A
GUN,
DID
MURDER
HER;
AS
THAT
NAME'S
CURSED
HAND
MURDER'D
HER
KINSMAN.
O,
TELL
ME,
FRIAR,
TELL
ME,
IN
WHAT
VILE
PART
OF
THIS
ANATOMY
DOTH
MY
NAME
LODGE?
TELL
ME,
THAT
I
MAY
SACK
THE
HATEFUL
MANSION.
DRAWING
HIS
SWORD

FRIAR
LAURENCE
HOLD
THY
DESPERATE
HAND:
ART
THOU
A
MAN?
THY
FORM
CRIES
OUT
THOU
ART:
THY
TEARS
ARE
WOMANISH;
THY
WILD
ACTS
DENOTE
THE
UNREASONABLE
FURY
OF
A
BEAST:
UNSEEMLY
WOMAN
IN
A
SEEMING
MAN!
OR
ILL-BESEEMING
BEAST
IN
SEEMING
BOTH!
THOU
HAST
AMAZED
ME:
BY
MY
HOLY
ORDER,
I
THOUGHT
THY
DISPOSITION
BETTER
TEMPER'D.
HAST
THOU
SLAIN
TYBALT?
WILT
THOU
SLAY
THYSELF?
AND
STAY
THY
LADY
TOO
THAT
LIVES
IN
THEE,
BY
DOING
DAMNED
HATE
UPON
THYSELF?
WHY
RAIL'ST
THOU
ON
THY
BIRTH,
THE
HEAVEN,
AND
EARTH?
SINCE
BIRTH,
AND
HEAVEN,
AND
EARTH,
ALL
THREE
DO
MEET
IN
THEE
AT
ONCE;
WHICH
THOU
AT
ONCE
WOULDST
LOSE.
FIE,
FIE,
THOU
SHAMEST
THY
SHAPE,
THY
LOVE,
THY
WIT;
WHICH,
LIKE
A
USURER,
ABOUND'ST
IN
ALL,
AND
USEST
NONE
IN
THAT
TRUE
USE
INDEED
WHICH
SHOULD
BEDECK
THY
SHAPE,
THY
LOVE,
THY
WIT:
THY
NOBLE
SHAPE
IS
BUT
A
FORM
OF
WAX,
DIGRESSING
FROM
THE
VALOUR
OF
A
MAN;
THY
DEAR
LOVE
SWORN
BUT
HOLLOW
PERJURY,
KILLING
THAT
LOVE
WHICH
THOU
HAST
VOW'D
TO
CHERISH;
THY
WIT,
THAT
ORNAMENT
TO
SHAPE
AND
LOVE,
MISSHAPEN
IN
THE
CONDUCT
OF
THEM
BOTH,
LIKE
POWDER
IN
A
SKITLESS
SOLDIER'S
FLASK,
IS
SET
AFIRE
BY

ENTER
ROMEO
AND
JULIET
ABOVE,
AT
THE

JULIET
WILT
THOU
BE
GONE?
IT
IS
NOT
YET
NEAR
DAY:
IT
WAS
THE
NIGHTINGALE,
AND
NOT
THE
LARK,
THAT
PIERCED
THE
FEARFUL
HOLLOW
OF
THINE
EAR;
NIGHTLY
SHE
SINGS
ON
YON
POMEGRANATE-TREE:
BELIEVE
ME,
LOVE,
IT
WAS
THE
NIGHTINGALE.
ROMEO
IT
WAS
THE
LARK,
THE
HERALD
OF
THE
MORN,
NO
NIGHTINGALE:
LOOK,
LOVE,
WHAT
ENVIOUS
STREAKS
DO
LACE
THE
SEVERING
CLOUDS
IN
YONDER
EAST:
NIGHT'S
CANDLES
ARE
BURNT
OUT,
AND
JOCUND
DAY
STANDS
TIPTOE
ON
THE
MISTY
MOUNTAIN
TOPS.
I
MUST
BE
GONE

DIE.
JULIET
YON
LIGHT

THIS

A
TORCH-BEARER,
AND
LIGHT

THEREFORE
STAY

THOU
NEED'ST
NOT
TO
BE
GONE.
ROMEO
LET
ME
BE
TA'EN,
LET
ME
BE
PUT
TO
DEATH;
I
AM
CONTENT,
SO
THOU
WILT
HAVE
IT

I'LL
SAY
YON
GREY
IS
NOT
THE
MORNING'S
EYE,
'TIS
BUT
THE
PALE
REFLEX
OF
CYNTHIA'S
BROW;
NOR
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
LARK,
WHOSE
NOTES
DO
BEAT
THE
VAULTY
HEAVEN
SO
HIGH
ABOVE
OUR
HEADS:
I
HAVE
MORE
CARE
TO

COME,
DEATH,

WELCOME!
JULIET
WILLS

SO.
HOW

LET'S

IT

THE
LARK
THAT
SINGS
SO
OUT
OF
TUNE,
STRAINING
HARSH
DISCORDS
AND
UNPLEASING
SHARPS.
SOME

THE
LARK

ROMEO
I
DOUBT

AND
ALL
THESE
WOES
SHALL

FOR
SWEET
DISCOURSES
IN
OUR

TO
COME.
JULIET
O

SOUL!
METHINKS

ROMEO

JULIET
MADAM,

DEATH?
WHAT,
WILT
THOU
WASH
HIM
FROM
HIS
GRAVE
WITH
TEARS?
AN
IF
THOU
COULDST,
THOU
COULDST
NOT
MAKE
HIM
LIVE;
THEREFORE,
HAVE
DONE:
SOME
GRIEF
SHOWS
MUCH
OF
LOVE;
BUT
MUCH
OF
GRIEF
SHOWS
STILL
SOME
WANT
OF
WIT.
JULIET
YET
LET
ME
WEEP
FOR
SUCH
A
FEELING
LOSS.
LADY
CAPULET
SO
SHALL
YOU
FEEL
THE
LOSS,
BUT
NOT
THE
FRIEND
WHICH
YOU
WEEP
FOR.
JULIET
FEELING
SO
THE
LOSS,
CANNOT
CHOOSE
BUT
EVER
WEEP
THE
FRIEND.
LADY
CAPULET
WELL,
GIRL,
THOU
WEEP'ST
NOT
SO
MUCH
FOR
HIS
DEATH,
AS
THAT
THE
VILLAIN
LIVES
WHICH

GOD
PARDON

JULIET
AY,
MADAM,
FROM

COUSIN'S
DEATH!
LADY
CAPULET
WE

HAVE
VENGEANCE
FOR

FEAR

WEEP
NO

I'LL
SEND
TO

IN
MANTUA,
WHERE
THAT
SAME
BANISH'D
RUNAGATE
DOTH
LIVE,
SHALL
GIVE
HIM
SUCH
AN
UNACCUSTOM'D
DRAM,
THAT
HE
SHALL
SOON
KEEP
TYBALT
COMPANY:
AND
THEN,
I
HOPE,
THOU
WILT
BE
SATISFIED.
JULIET
INDEED,
I
NEVER
SHALL
BE
SATISFIED
WITH
ROMEO,
TILL
I
BEHOLD
HIM--DEAD--
IS

POOR
HEART

KINSMAN
VEX'D.
MADAM,
IF
YOU
COULD
FIND

TO
BEAR
A
POISON,
I
WOULD
TEMPER
IT;
THAT
ROMEO
SHOULD,
UPON
RECEIPT
THEREOF,
SOON
SLEEP
IN
QUIET.
O,
HOW
MY
HEART
ABHORS
TO
HEAR
HIM
NAMED,
AND
CANNOT
COME
TO
HIM.
TO
WREAK
THE
LOVE
I
BORE
MY
COUSIN
UPON
HIS
BODY
THAT
SLAUGHTER'D
HIM!
LADY
CAPULET
FIND

THE
MEANS,
AND
I'LL
FIND
SUCH
A
MAN.
BUT
NOW
I'LL
TELL

JOYFUL
TIDINGS,

JULIET
NOW,

SAINT
PETER'S

AND
PETER

A
JOYFUL
BRIDE.
I

AND,
WHEN

I
SWEAR,
IT
SHALL
BE
ROMEO,
WHOM
YOU
KNOW
I
HATE,
RATHER
THAN
PARIS.
THESE
ARE
NEWS
INDEED!
LADY

JULIET
IS
THERE
NO
PITY
SITTING
IN
THE

MY
GRIEF?
O,
SWEET
MY
MOTHER,
CAST
ME
NOT
AWAY!
DELAY
THIS
MARRIAGE
FOR
A
MONTH,
A
WEEK;
OR,
IF
YOU
DO
NOT,
MAKE
THE
BRIDAL
BED
IN
THAT
DIM
MONUMENT
WHERE
TYBALT
LIES.
LADY
CAPULET
TALK
NOT
TO

HAVE
DONE
WITH
THEE.
EXIT

JULIET
O
GOD!--O
NURSE,
HOW
SHALL
THIS
BE
PREVENTED?
MY
HUSBAND
IS
ON
EARTH,
MY
FAITH
IN

HOW
SHALL
THAT
FAITH
RETURN
AGAIN
TO
EARTH,
UNLESS
THAT
HUSBAND
SEND
IT
ME
FROM
HEAVEN
BY
LEAVING
EARTH?
COMFORT
ME,
COUNSEL
ME.
ALACK,
ALACK,
THAT
HEAVEN
SHOULD
PRACTISE
STRATAGEMS
UPON
SO
SOFT
A
SUBJECT
AS
MYSELF!
WHAT
SAY'ST
THOU?
HAST
THOU
NOT
A
WORD
OF
JOY?
SOME
COMFORT,
NURSE.
NURSE
FAITH,
HERE
IT
IS.
ROMEO
IS
BANISH'D;
AND
ALL
THE
WORLD
TO
NOTHING,
THAT
HE
DARES
NE'ER
COME
BACK
TO
CHALLENGE
YOU;
OR,
IF
HE
DO,
IT
NEEDS
MUST
BE
BY
STEALTH.
THEN,
SINCE
THE
CASE
SO
STANDS
AS
NOW
IT
DOTH,
I
THINK
IT
BEST
YOU
MARRIED
WITH
THE
COUNTY.
O,
HE'S
A
LOVELY
GENTLEMAN!
ROMEO'S
A
DISHCLOUT
TO
HIM:
AN
EAGLE,
MADAM,
HATH
NOT
SO
GREEN,
SO
QUICK,
SO
FAIR

HATH.
BESHREW
MY
VERY
HEART,
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
HAPPY
IN
THIS
SECOND
MATCH,
FOR
IT
EXCELS
YOUR
FIRST:
OR
IF
IT

NOT,
YOUR
FIRST
IS
DEAD;
OR
'TWERE
AS
GOOD
HE
WERE,
AS
LIVING
HERE
AND
YOU
NO

THOU
FROM

BESHREW

JULIET
AMEN!

HAVING
DISPLEASED
MY

THIS
IS
WISELY
DONE.

JULIET
ANCIENT
DAMNATION!
O
MOST
WICKED

IS
IT

DISPRAISE
MY
LORD
WITH
THAT
SAME
TONGUE
WHICH
SHE
HATH
PRAISED
HIM
WITH
ABOVE
COMPARE
SO
MANY
THOUSAND
TIMES?
GO,
COUNSELLOR;
THOU
AND
MY
BOSOM
HENCEFORTH
SHALL
BE

I'LL

TO
KNOW

HAVE
POWER
TO
DIE.

FRIAR
LAURENCE
ON
THURSDAY,
SIR?
THE
TIME
IS
VERY
SHORT.
PARIS
MY
FATHER
CAPULET
WILL
HAVE
IT
SO;
AND
I
AM
NOTHING
SLOW
TO
SLACK
HIS
HASTE.
FRIAR
LAURENCE
YOU
SAY
YOU
DO
NOT
KNOW
THE
LADY'S
MIND:
UNEVEN
IS
THE
COURSE,
I
LIKE
IT
NOT.
PARIS
IMMODERATELY
SHE
WEEPS
FOR
TYBALT'S
DEATH,
AND
THEREFORE
HAVE
I
LITTLE
TALK'D
OF
LOVE;
FOR
VENUS
SMILES
NOT
IN
A
HOUSE
OF
TEARS.
NOW,
SIR,
HER
FATHER
COUNTS
IT
DANGEROUS
THAT
SHE
DOTH
GIVE
HER
SORROW
SO
MUCH
SWAY,
AND
IN
HIS
WISDOM
HASTES
OUR
MARRIAGE,
TO
STOP
THE
INUNDATION
OF
HER
TEARS;
WHICH,
TOO
MUCH
MINDED
BY
HERSELF
ALONE,
MAY
BE
PUT
FROM
HER
BY
SOCIETY:
NOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
THE
REASON
OF
THIS
HASTE.
FRIAR
LAURENCE
[ASIDE]
I
WOULD
I
KNEW
NOT
WHY
IT
SHOULD
BE
SLOW'D.
LOOK,
SIR,
HERE
COMES
THE
LADY
TOWARDS
MY

ENTER
JULIET

PARIS
HAPPILY
MET,
MY
LADY
AND
MY
WIFE!
JULIET
THAT

SIR,
WHEN
I
MAY
BE
A
WIFE.
PARIS
THAT
MAY
BE
MUST
BE,
LOVE,
ON
THURSDAY
NEXT.
JULIET
WHAT
MUST
BE
SHALL
BE.
FRIAR
LAURENCE
THAT'S
A
CERTAIN
TEXT.
PARIS
COME
YOU
TO
MAKE
CONFESSION
TO
THIS
FATHER?
JULIET
TO
ANSWER
THAT,
I
SHOULD
CONFESS
TO
YOU.
PARIS
DO
NOT
DENY
TO
HIM
THAT
YOU
LOVE
ME.
JULIET
I
WILL
CONFESS
TO
YOU
THAT
I
LOVE
HIM.
PARIS
SO
WILL
YE,
I
AM
SURE,
THAT
YOU
LOVE
ME.
JULIET
IF
I
DO
SO,
IT
WILL
BE
OF
MORE
PRICE,
BEING
SPOKE
BEHIND
YOUR
BACK,
THAN
TO
YOUR
FACE.
PARIS
POOR
SOUL,
THY
FACE
IS
MUCH
ABUSED
WITH
TEARS.
JULIET
THE
TEARS
HAVE
GOT
SMALL
VICTORY
BY
THAT;
FOR
IT
WAS
BAD
ENOUGH
BEFORE
THEIR
SPITE.
PARIS
THOU
WRONG'ST
IT,
MORE
THAN
TEARS,
WITH
THAT
REPORT.
JULIET
THAT
IS
NO
SLANDER,
SIR,
WHICH
IS
A
TRUTH;
AND
WHAT
I
SPAKE,
I
SPAKE
IT
TO
MY
FACE.
PARIS
THY
FACE
IS
MINE,
AND
THOU
HAST
SLANDER'D
IT.
JULIET
IT
MAY
BE
SO,
FOR
IT
IS
NOT
MINE
OWN.
ARE
YOU
AT
LEISURE,
HOLY
FATHER,
NOW;
OR
SHALL
I
COME
TO
YOU
AT
EVENING
MASS?
FRIAR
LAURENCE
MY
LEISURE
SERVES
ME,
PENSIVE
DAUGHTER,
NOW.
MY
LORD,
WE
MUST
ENTREAT
THE
TIME
ALONE.
PARIS
GOD

I
SHOULD
DISTURB
DEVOTION!
JULIET,
ON
THURSDAY
EARLY
WILL
I
ROUSE
YE:

THEN,
ADIEU;
AND
KEEP
THIS
HOLY
KISS.
EXIT

JULIET
O
SHUT
THE
DOOR!
AND
WHEN
THOU
HAST
DONE
SO,
COME
WEEP
WITH
ME;
PAST
HOPE,
PAST
CURE,
PAST
HELP!
FRIAR
LAURENCE
AH,
JULIET,
I
ALREADY
KNOW
THY
GRIEF;
IT
STRAINS
ME
PAST
THE
COMPASS
OF
MY
WITS:
I
HEAR
THOU
MUST,
AND
NOTHING
MAY
PROROGUE
IT,
ON
THURSDAY
NEXT
BE
MARRIED
TO
THIS
COUNTY.
JULIET
TELL
ME
NOT,
FRIAR,
THAT
THOU
HEAR'ST
OF
THIS,
UNLESS
THOU
TELL
ME
HOW
I
MAY
PREVENT
IT:
IF,
IN
THY
WISDOM,
THOU
CANST
GIVE
NO
HELP,
DO
THOU
BUT
CALL
MY
RESOLUTION
WISE,
AND
WITH
THIS
KNIFE
I'LL
HELP
IT
PRESENTLY.
GOD
JOIN'D
MY
HEART
AND
ROMEO'S,
THOU
OUR
HANDS;
AND
ERE
THIS
HAND,
BY
THEE
TO
ROMEO
SEAL'D,
SHALL
BE
THE
LABEL
TO
ANOTHER
DEED,
OR
MY
TRUE
HEART
WITH
TREACHEROUS
REVOLT
TURN
TO
ANOTHER,
THIS
SHALL
SLAY
THEM
BOTH:
THEREFORE,
OUT
OF
THY
LONG-EXPERIENCED
TIME,
GIVE
ME
SOME
PRESENT
COUNSEL,
OR,
BEHOLD,
'TWIXT
MY
EXTREMES
AND
ME
THIS
BLOODY
KNIFE
SHALL
PLAY
THE
UMPIRE,
ARBITRATING
THAT
WHICH
THE
COMMISSION
OF
THY
YEARS
AND
ART
COULD
TO
NO
ISSUE
OF
TRUE
HONOUR
BRING.
BE
NOT
SO
LONG
TO
SPEAK;
I
LONG
TO
DIE,
IF
WHAT
THOU
SPEAK'ST
SPEAK
NOT
OF
REMEDY.
FRIAR
LAURENCE
HOLD,
DAUGHTER:
I
DO
SPY
A
KIND
OF
HOPE,
WHICH
CRAVES
AS
DESPERATE
AN
EXECUTION.
AS
THAT
IS
DESPERATE
WHICH
WE
WOULD
PREVENT.
IF,
RATHER
THAN
TO
MARRY
COUNTY
PARIS,
THOU
HAST
THE
STRENGTH
OF
WILL
TO
SLAY
THYSELF,
THEN
IS
IT
LIKELY
THOU
WILT
UNDERTAKE
A
THING
LIKE
DEATH
TO
CHIDE
AWAY
THIS
SHAME,
THAT
COPEST
WITH
DEATH
HIMSELF
TO
SCAPE
FROM
IT:
AND,
IF
THOU
DAREST,
I'LL
GIVE
THEE
REMEDY.
JULIET
O,
BID
ME
LEAP,
RATHER
THAN
MARRY
PARIS,
FROM
OFF
THE
BATTLEMENTS
OF
YONDER
TOWER;
OR
WALK
IN
THIEVISH
WAYS;
OR
BID
ME
LURK
WHERE
SERPENTS
ARE;
CHAIN
ME
WITH
ROARING
BEARS;
OR
SHUT
ME
NIGHTLY
IN
A
CHARNEL-HOUSE,
O'ER-COVER'D
QUITE
WITH
DEAD
MEN'S
RATTLING
BONES,
WITH
REEKY
SHANKS
AND
YELLOW
CHAPLESS
SKULLS;
OR
BID
ME
GO
INTO
A
NEW-MADE
GRAVE
AND
HIDE
ME
WITH
A
DEAD
MAN
IN
HIS
SHROUD;
THINGS
THAT,
TO
HEAR
THEM
TOLD,
HAVE
MADE
ME
TREMBLE;
AND
I
WILL
DO
IT
WITHOUT
FEAR
OR
DOUBT,
TO
LIVE
AN
UNSTAIN'D
WIFE
TO
MY
SWEET
LOVE.
FRIAR
LAURENCE
HOLD,
THEN;
GO
HOME,
BE
MERRY,
GIVE
CONSENT
TO
MARRY
PARIS:
WEDNESDAY
IS
TO-MORROW:
TO-MORROW
NIGHT
LOOK
THAT
THOU
LIE
ALONE;
LET
NOT

IN

CHAMBER:
TAKE

IN

AND

DISTILLED
LIQUOR

THOU
OFF;
WHEN
PRESENTLY
THROUGH
ALL
THY
VEINS
SHALL
RUN
A
COLD
AND
DROWSY
HUMOUR,
FOR
NO
PULSE
SHALL
KEEP
HIS
NATIVE
PROGRESS,
BUT
SURCEASE:
NO
WARMTH,
NO
BREATH,
SHALL
TESTIFY
THOU
LIVEST;
THE
ROSES
IN
THY
LIPS
AND
CHEEKS
SHALL
FADE
TO
PALY
ASHES,
THY
EYES'
WINDOWS
FALL,
LIKE
DEATH,
WHEN
HE
SHUTS
UP
THE
DAY
OF
LIFE;
EACH
PART,
DEPRIVED
OF
SUPPLE
GOVERNMENT,
SHALL,
STIFF
AND
STARK
AND
COLD,
APPEAR
LIKE
DEATH:
AND
IN
THIS
BORROW'D
LIKENESS
OF
SHRUNK
DEATH
THOU
SHALT
CONTINUE
TWO
AND
FORTY
HOURS,
AND
THEN
AWAKE
AS
FROM
A
PLEASANT
SLEEP.
NOW,
WHEN
THE
BRIDEGROOM
IN
THE
MORNING
COMES
TO
ROUSE
THEE
FROM
THY
BED,
THERE
ART
THOU
DEAD:
THEN,
AS
THE
MANNER
OF
OUR
COUNTRY
IS,
IN
THY
BEST
ROBES
UNCOVER'D
ON
THE
BIER
THOU
SHALT
BE
BORNE
TO

ANCIENT
VAULT
WHERE
ALL
THE
KINDRED

IN
THE
MEAN
TIME,
AGAINST
THOU
SHALT
AWAKE,
SHALL
ROMEO
BY
MY
LETTERS
KNOW
OUR
DRIFT,
AND
HITHER
SHALL
HE
COME:
AND
HE
AND
I
WILL
WATCH
THY
WAKING,
AND
THAT
VERY
NIGHT
SHALL
ROMEO
BEAR
THEE
HENCE
TO
MANTUA.
AND
THIS
SHALL
FREE
THEE
FROM
THIS
PRESENT
SHAME;

NOR

ABATE
THY
VALOUR
IN

IF
YOU

DISPATCH

ROMEO
THERE

WORSE

DOING

UNHAPPY

BY

ART
EARLY
UP,
TO
SEE
THY
SON
AND
HEIR
MORE
EARLY
DOWN.
MONTAGUE
ALAS,
MY
LIEGE,
MY
WIFE
IS
DEAD
TO-NIGHT;
GRIEF
OF
MY
SON'S
EXILE
HATH
STOPP'D
HER
BREATH:
WHAT
FURTHER
WOE
CONSPIRES
AGAINST
MINE
AGE?
PRINCE
LOOK,
AND
THOU
SHALT
SEE.
MONTAGUE
O
THOU
UNTAUGHT!
WHAT
MANNERS
IS
IN
THIS?
TO
PRESS
BEFORE
THY
FATHER
TO
A
GRAVE?
PRINCE
SEAL
UP
THE
MOUTH
OF
OUTRAGE
FOR
A
WHILE,
TILL
WE
CAN
CLEAR
THESE
AMBIGUITIES,
AND
KNOW
THEIR
SPRING,
THEIR
HEAD,
THEIR
TRUE
DESCENT;
AND
THEN
WILL
I
BE
GENERAL
OF
YOUR
WOES,
AND
LEAD
YOU
EVEN
TO
DEATH:
MEANTIME
FORBEAR,
AND
LET
MISCHANCE
BE
SLAVE
TO
PATIENCE.
BRING
FORTH
THE
PARTIES
OF
SUSPICION.
FRIAR
LAURENCE
I
AM
THE
GREATEST,
ABLE
TO
DO
LEAST,
YET
MOST
SUSPECTED,
AS
THE
TIME
AND
PLACE
DOTH
MAKE
AGAINST
ME
OF
THIS
DIREFUL
MURDER;
AND
HERE
I
STAND,
BOTH
TO
IMPEACH
AND
PURGE
MYSELF
CONDEMNED
AND
MYSELF
EXCUSED.
PRINCE
THEN
SAY
AT
ONCE
WHAT
THOU
DOST
KNOW
IN
THIS.
FRIAR
LAURENCE
I
WILL
BE
BRIEF,
FOR
MY
SHORT
DATE
OF
BREATH
IS
NOT
SO
LONG
AS
IS
A
TEDIOUS
TALE.
ROMEO,
THERE
DEAD,
WAS
HUSBAND
TO
THAT
JULIET;
AND
SHE,
THERE
DEAD,
THAT
ROMEO'S
FAITHFUL
WIFE:
I
MARRIED
THEM;
AND
THEIR
STOL'N
MARRIAGE-DAY
WAS
TYBALT'S
DOOMS-DAY,
WHOSE
UNTIMELY
DEATH
BANISH'D
THE
NEW-MADE
BRIDEGROOM
FROM
THE
CITY,
FOR
WHOM,
AND
NOT
FOR
TYBALT,
JULIET
PINED.
YOU,
TO
REMOVE
THAT
SIEGE
OF
GRIEF
FROM
HER,
BETROTH'D
AND
WOULD
HAVE
MARRIED
HER
PERFORCE
TO
COUNTY
PARIS:
THEN
COMES
SHE
TO
ME,
AND,
WITH
WILD
LOOKS,
BID
ME
DEVISE
SOME
MEAN
TO
RID
HER
FROM
THIS
SECOND
MARRIAGE,
OR
IN
MY
CELL
THERE
WOULD
SHE
KILL
HERSELF.
THEN
GAVE
I
HER,
SO
TUTOR'D
BY
MY
ART,
A
SLEEPING
POTION;
WHICH
SO
TOOK
EFFECT
AS
I
INTENDED,
FOR
IT
WROUGHT
ON
HER
THE
FORM
OF
DEATH:
MEANTIME
I
WRIT
TO
ROMEO,
THAT
HE
SHOULD
HITHER
COME
AS
THIS
DIRE
NIGHT,
TO
HELP
TO
TAKE
HER
FROM
HER
BORROW'D
GRAVE,
BEING
THE
TIME
THE
POTION'S
FORCE
SHOULD
CEASE.
BUT
HE
WHICH
BORE
MY
LETTER,
FRIAR
JOHN,
WAS
STAY'D
BY
ACCIDENT,
AND
YESTERNIGHT
RETURN'D
MY
LETTER
BACK.
THEN
ALL
ALONE
AT
THE
PREFIXED
HOUR
OF
HER
WAKING,
CAME
I
TO
TAKE
HER
FROM
HER
KINDRED'S
VAULT;
MEANING
TO
KEEP
HER
CLOSELY
AT
MY
CELL,
TILL
I
CONVENIENTLY
COULD
SEND
TO
ROMEO:
BUT
WHEN
I
CAME,
SOME
MINUTE
ERE
THE
TIME
OF
HER
AWAKING,
HERE
UNTIMELY
LAY
THE
NOBLE
PARIS
AND
TRUE
ROMEO
DEAD.
SHE
WAKES;
AND
I
ENTREATED
HER
COME
FORTH,
AND
BEAR
THIS
WORK
OF
HEAVEN
WITH
PATIENCE:
BUT
THEN
A
NOISE
DID
SCARE
ME
FROM
THE
TOMB;
AND
SHE,
TOO
DESPERATE,
WOULD
NOT
GO
WITH
ME,
BUT,
AS
IT
SEEMS,
DID
VIOLENCE
ON
HERSELF.
ALL
THIS
I
KNOW;
AND
TO
THE
MARRIAGE
HER
NURSE
IS
PRIVY:
AND,
IF
AUGHT
IN
THIS
MISCARRIED
BY
MY
FAULT,
LET
MY
OLD
LIFE
BE
SACRIFICED,
SOME
HOUR
BEFORE
HIS
TIME,
UNTO
THE
RIGOUR
OF
SEVEREST
LAW.
PRINCE
WE
STILL
HAVE
KNOWN
THEE
FOR
A
HOLY
MAN.
WHERE'S
ROMEO'S
MAN?
WHAT
CAN
HE
SAY
IN
THIS?
BALTHASAR
I
BROUGHT
MY
MASTER
NEWS
OF
JULIET'S
DEATH;
AND
THEN
IN
POST
HE
CAME
FROM
MANTUA
TO
THIS
SAME
PLACE,
TO
THIS
SAME
MONUMENT.
THIS
LETTER
HE
EARLY
BID
ME
GIVE
HIS
FATHER,
AND
THREATENED
ME
WITH
DEATH,
GOING
IN
THE
VAULT,
I
DEPARTED
NOT
AND
LEFT
HIM
THERE.
PRINCE
GIVE
ME
THE
LETTER;
I
WILL
LOOK
ON
IT.
WHERE
IS
THE
COUNTY'S
PAGE,
THAT
RAISED
THE
WATCH?
SIRRAH,
WHAT
MADE
YOUR
MASTER
IN
THIS
PLACE?
PAGE
HE
CAME
WITH
FLOWERS
TO
STREW
HIS
LADY'S
GRAVE;
AND
BID
ME
STAND
ALOOF,
AND
SO
I
DID:
ANON
COMES
ONE
WITH
LIGHT
TO
OPE
THE
TOMB;
AND
BY
AND
BY
MY
MASTER
DREW
ON
HIM;
AND
THEN
I
RAN
AWAY
TO
CALL
THE
WATCH.
PRINCE
THIS
LETTER
DOTH
MAKE
GOOD
THE
FRIAR'S
WORDS,
THEIR
COURSE
OF
LOVE,
THE
TIDINGS
OF
HER
DEATH:
AND
HERE
HE
WRITES
THAT
HE
DID
BUY
A
POISON
OF
A
POOR
'POTHECARY,
AND
THEREWITHAL
CAME
TO
THIS
VAULT
TO
DIE,
AND
LIE
WITH
JULIET.
WHERE
BE
THESE
ENEMIES?
CAPULET!
MONTAGUE!
SEE,
WHAT
A
SCOURGE
IS
LAID
UPON
YOUR
HATE,
THAT
HEAVEN
FINDS
MEANS
TO
KILL
YOUR
JOYS
WITH
LOVE.
AND
I
FOR
WINKING
AT
YOUR
DISCORDS
TOO
HAVE
LOST
A
BRACE
OF
KINSMEN:
ALL
ARE
PUNISH'D.
CAPULET
O
BROTHER
MONTAGUE,
GIVE
ME
THY
HAND:
THIS
IS
MY
DAUGHTER'S
JOINTURE,
FOR
NO
MORE
CAN
I
DEMAND.
MONTAGUE
BUT
I
CAN
GIVE
THEE
MORE:
FOR
I
WILL
RAISE
HER
STATUE
IN
PURE
GOLD;
THAT
WHILE
VERONA
BY
THAT
NAME
IS
KNOWN,
THERE
SHALL
NO
FIGURE
AT
SUCH
RATE
BE
SET
AS
THAT
OF
TRUE
AND
FAITHFUL
JULIET.
CAPULET
AS
RICH
SHALL
ROMEO'S
BY
HIS
LADY'S
LIE;
POOR
SACRIFICES
OF
OUR
ENMITY!
PRINCE
A
GLOOMING
PEACE
THIS
MORNING
WITH
IT
BRINGS;
THE
SUN,
FOR
SORROW,
WILL
NOT
SHOW
HIS
HEAD:
GO
HENCE,
TO
HAVE
MORE
TALK
OF
THESE
SAD
THINGS;
SOME
SHALL
BE
PARDON'D,
AND
SOME
PUNISHED:
FOR
NEVER
WAS
A
STORY
OF
MORE
WOE
THAN
THIS
OF
JULIET
AND
HER
ROMEO.
